{"pages":[{"name":"Monster Mage","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Wizards study dusty tomes in their towers and sorcerers rely on the power they were born to running through their blood, but you forge a different path. You search the world for monsters and defeat them to learn their spells. If you can slay enough monsters, your collection might grow larger than anything those other spellcaster can imagine.</p>\n<p>The basis for your magic is a magical process of creating tokens from slain foes to learn one of the spells they could cast. Each token stores a single spell, and as you collect more tokens, the versatility of your magic grows with your collection. Your tokens only work for you, and as long as they remain in your possession, they glow with a faint azure hue. Due to this fact, those who don't understand the process of becoming a monster mage who see the blue glow and think that is the source of the magic sometimes mistakenly call monster mages \"azure mages,\" \"cerulean mages,\" and other such titles.</p>\n<p>No one is sure precisely where or when the study of monster magic began, but it's a highly personal journey. The basic principles require teaching, whether from a mentor or self-studied with the use of books, but beyond that, it's up to you to learn the magic that monsters can offer. A monster mage's path to power is not always linear. For every monster mage interested in growing in raw power through dangerous adventures, another monster mage disappears into the wilderness and methodically defeats weak monsters until they return with the knowledge of countless spells.</p>\n<p>The monster mage archetype synergizes well with the system of crafting with monster parts, since you have a lot of incentive to hunt down monsters anyway, getting what you want doesn't reduce the value of your monster parts, and keeping track of the spells monsters know is useful both for you and for someone want to add a spell imbued property.</p>\n<h2>Monster Tokens</h2>\n<p>As a monster mage, your collection of tokens is as personal and as vital as a wizard's spellbook or a witch's familiar, as you commune with the power of your tokens to prepare your spells. As such, your tokens can take as many different forms as there are customs and conventions among monster mages. If you're focused on the idea that the eyes are the pathways to the will, and to magic, you might preserve the eyes of various creatures inside amber to act as your tokens. Instead, if you were more interested in the way that creatures draw upon the ambient magic of the world around them through their outer bodies, you might create tokens out of scales, plates, feathers, bits of exoskeleton, tufts of hair, or skin.</p>\n<p>Your customs when it comes to creating tokens are up to you. However, if multiple people in your group are playing monster mages, vestige hunters, or other characters who might be interested in exactly what pieces of a creature they are able to salvage, be sure to coordinate to make sure you won't block each other from creating tokens, vestiges, or other bits of gear from the same creature. For instance, if another player is playing a monster mage that uses a creature's eyes to make tokens, you probably shouldn't choose to use a creature's eyes as well, or something that includes the eyes like the entire intact head. In general, the more of the creature you are using, the more likely that it'll come into conflict, so keep that in mind when you make your decision. Ultimately, you can always have your character be flexible with their customs for creating tokens to work with your party's needs. The magic works just as well no matter what, and many monster mages, like Zara, mix and match tokens of various sorts.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e.pf2e-battlezoo-feats-and-actions.ZnOMjuTmAus26JEs]{Monster Mage Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You must defeat a monster with an innate cantrip and preserve a piece to create your first token</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have completed the process to become a monster mage by defeating a monster and creating a token, a small magical receptacle created from a piece of the monster allowing you to store the monster's magic. Choose one of the innate cantrips from the monster you defeated for the prerequisite; you create a token from that monster's body which contains that cantrip, using the same tradition as the monster did. Write down the kind of monster, the spell, the tradition, and a quick description of the token's appearance. You cast spells by preparing them from your tokens, which you collect from the monsters you defeat using the Create Token activity. Your tokens only work for you, and you can't share spells with other spellcasters, even other monster mages, or use the Learn a Spell activity to learn more monster mage spells. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} activity. You can prepare up to two cantrips each day from the spells in your tokens (though you only start with one initially until you defeat another monster with a different innate cantrip). You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the spells you can from your tokens regardless of their tradition, but you don't become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for other spells you cast. Your key spellcasting ability for monster mage archetype spells is Wisdom, and when you cast them they are monster mage spells cast from spell slots, not innate spells. You gain the Additional Lore skill feat, and must choose a Lore skill associated with a monster.

{"pages":[{"name":"Gathering Ingredients","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The first step in upgrading weapons with monster parts is gathering suitable parts. After a battle, the PCs can spend 10 minutes to gather the monsters' parts (a PC can instead take their time to gain a greater value of parts, see @UUID[.nGuakGIOSVfMGSal#gathering-more-from-monsters]{Gathering More from Monsters}). The time it takes to gather normally does not depend on how big or numerous the monsters were, though the GM might determine that a battle with particularly enormous or numerous monsters require multiple 10 minute increments to gather all the parts. Gathering parts automatically succeeds without a check. Monster parts vary in Bulk based on the original monster, but they generally tend to be extremely bulky. While the Bulk is at the GM's discretion, typical Bulk values are light Bulk for the parts of a Small creature, 1 Bulk for Medium, 2 Bulk for Large, 4 Bulk for Huge, and 8 Bulk for Gargantuan. As such, it is usually a good idea for PCs to use the parts quickly to upgrade their items via refining and imbuing.</p>\n<p>While many monster parts are gathered by harvesting them directly from monsters, most campaigns will include opponents that are not sources of parts (such as human foes). These foes might instead carry refined items that the PCs can break down for useful parts for their own equipment, or even unrefined monster parts. The PCs can keep track of monster parts by their value, as well as the monster that provided them (for instance, \"12 gp of giant crab parts\"). This represents a variety of parts from those creatures, and the PCs can split the value of parts as needed. For instance, if the PCs used 10 gp of those giant crab parts to refine a weapon, they would have 2 gp of giant crab parts remaining.</p>\n<p>It's recommended that the PCs be allowed to allocate and spend monster parts shortly after earning them, to avoid needing to drag along bulky materials and keep track of a large list of parts from different creatures and values (see @UUID[.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp]{Refining} for a discussion on how to allocate these quickly). As the GM, you determine the value of the monster parts the PCs find. To determine how much value in monsters parts, as well as other treasure, PCs should be earning over the course of a level, use the appropriate Party Treasure by Level table: Table 1A for the Light variant, Table 1B for the Hybrid variant, or Table 1C for the Full variant. These tables replace the Table 10-9: Party Treasure table of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>For GMs looking to select treasure for a single encounter, use the tables of monster parts per monster: @UUID[.4fEHHC8rPQ9QdQbs]{Table 2A: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Light Variant)}, @UUID[.obYR3VU6GlKETeaM]{Table 2B: Monster Parts gained Per Monster (Hybrid Variant)}, or @UUID[.ReyFC8M7eS2fuY3t]{Table 2C: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Full Variant)}. These tables work on the same encounter building assumptions used in the Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide Treasure by Encounter table. This means they provide approximately the right amount of monster parts for the level if the GM uses about 640 XP worth of monsters that grant monster parts, with the rest of the XP from hazards and achievements and the rest of the wealth from \"Extra Treasure\" (as indicated in the final column in the Gamemastery Guide's table) found in caches, treasure chests, and other such locations. The GM can supply some or all of the Extra Treasure in the form of monster parts given as rewards for the PCs' accomplishments. In the Full variant, if the GM wants to have more monster battles than normal for each level, she can just use 800 XP worth of monsters instead of giving Extra Treasure (with the rest of the XP from hazards and achievements).</p>\n<p>GMs can also use the monster parts per monster table to adjust a prepublished adventure to use this system. Simply add the listed monster parts by level for each opponent, and then subtract the appropriate amount of other treasure elsewhere (just currency for Light, coin and half the permanent items for Hybrid, and everything for Full).</p>\n<p>Because treasure doesn't vary at exactly the same rate as experience, it is possible that if your group's encounters are particularly skewed towards single opponents above the party's level or many weak opponents; these situations might wind up giving a value of monster parts that is above or below expectations. This is especially true with very low level monsters and with monsters levels 17 through 20; the values for low levels monsters have been adjusted slightly to reduce this effect. Because of these factors, the tables for monster parts over the course of an entire level (@UUID[.yf9S7HMivMefgXCH]{Table 1A: Party Treasure by Level (Light Variant)}, @UUID[.LTknKePHeDQWhKGV]{Table 1B: Party Treasure by Level (Hybrid Variant)}, @UUID[.cd1zRDDvOhb9m33Y]{Table 1C: Party Treasure by Level (Full Variant)}) more accurately represent an appropriate amount of treasure than the monster parts value per monster tables (Tables 2A through 2C). However, the parts per monster tables are easier and more convenient to use when building encounters; GMs can use either or both sets of tables to suit their style of running games.</p>\n<p>For example, a group of 4 level 10 PCs using the full variant just defeated a level 13 purple worm. According to @UUID[.cd1zRDDvOhb9m33Y]{Table 1C}, the GM should give out a total of 8,000 gp of monster parts for level 10 PCs, and the purple worm was worth 120 XP, representing a little over 1/5 of the total XP of monsters the party will face this level, so the GM decides to give the PCs 1,750 gp worth of monster parts. If the GM needed an answer quickly and hadn't planned out the treasure for the entire level, they could instead use @UUID[.ReyFC8M7eS2fuY3t]{Table 2C}, which says to give out 1,560 gp worth of monster parts since the monster was level 13.</p>\n<h1>What Makes a Monster?</h1>\n<p>This system works no matter how you define a monster, but, in most cases, PC ancestries like humans, elves, or orcs aren't a source for parts, except among evil groups that might wear leather armor made of tanned human skin, and the like. Similarly, while killing an angel for parts would work following these rules, most groups would likely balk at murdering a being of pure good. When it comes to a diplomatic solution, an angel or other creature the PCs befriend might be willing to offer some shed feathers, scales, or so on to use in item crafting. The way magic works, an angel's feather freely given to a worthy ally after a quest might have as much potential for crafting as many feathers taken from the corpse of a murdered angel. Since the system only measures the value of the parts, not the volume, you are free to make the decisions that work for your situation.</p>\n<h1>Trading Monster Parts</h1>\n<p>Monster parts typically aren’t sold on the open market, and they sell for half of their listed value if selling them is possible. If a monster's parts are inappropriate for any item the entire party wants to refine or imbue, the GM might allow the PCs to trade their findings with other adventurers for parts they can use.</p>\n<h1>Haunts and Hazards</h1>\n<p>PCs can also gather parts or residues from a hazard with a physical manifestation. You can use the value for a creature if it's a complex hazard, or 1/4 that value for a simple hazard.</p>\n<h1>Gathering More from Monsters</h1>\n<p>Regardless of the variant your group is using, a PC with an appropriate Lore skill (such as Dragon Lore when gathering dragon parts) can spend downtime carefully foraging from a monster corpse to increase the value of scavenged parts, using Earn Income with a task level equal to the monster's level. On a critical failure, or once they have doubled the value of the monster parts, the PC has garnered everything they can from this monster's corpse.

The necessary level to unlock imbuing varies from item to item; see Tables 4A through 4E for more details. Imbuing an item follows a similar process as refining: add monster parts that meet the requirements for the imbued property you want to add to the item. You can't use monster parts if they do not meet the requirements for the imbued property.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are imbuing a cold property, you can't use parts from a monster that doesn't have any cold abilities. Track this value separately from the monster parts you use to refine the item, and if the item is high enough level and of the right type to be imbued multiple times, track the value for each imbued property separately. Continue adding value to the imbued property as you use more parts to imbue the property, just like with refining.</p>\n<p>When you reach the values specified in @UUID[.HSk3HUSGXG3w7E7N]{Table 5A: Imbuing Cost by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)}} (if imbuing a weapon or suit of armor) or @UUID[.P72zXSYjr1T8Cnjq]{Table 5B: Imbuing Costs by Item Level (Shields, Perception Items, and Skill Items)} (if imbuing a shield, Perception item, or skill item), the imbued property levels up, potentially granting increased benefits to the item. Just like with refining, the value and benefits are cumulative, and you can keep adding value to increase the imbued property's level further and gain more benefits. An imbued property's level can never be higher than the item's level or your level, whichever is lower. Much like in refining, you can keep contributing monster parts and imbuing the property past that point, and in that case, the imbued property's level increases immediately once you refine the item enough to increase the item's refining level. Unlike refining, which only has a single option depending on the type of item, you can choose from several options when you imbue an item, and some of them have multiple upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your item to match your personal playstyle.</p>\n<h2>Imbued Properties</h2>\n<p>The following imbued properties are available when imbuing items with different kinds of monster parts. Sometimes an imbued property lists that the item gains either a specific spell, or a chosen spell that follows certain criteria. In this case, the item gains a command and Interact activation the same number of actions as the listed spell, with an effect of casting the listed spell. The item's DC for any effects is based on its item level, using the value from the Magic Item DCs table, found in the <em>Pathfinder Second Edition Gamemastery Guide</em>. If the item needs to make a spell attack roll or counteract check, its modifier is equal to its DC - 10.</p>\n<p>Some imbued properties, especially for weapons, have multiple upgrade paths, reflecting the different ways you can adjust the imbuing process. These paths are magic (emphasizing thematic spells), might (emphasizing direct damage), and technique (emphasizing special effects and damage over time). If the weapon is capable of holding multiple imbued properties, you can apply the same imbued property to the weapon multiple times as long as you choose a different path each time.</p>\n<p>To use an activated ability of an imbued property on a held item, such as a weapon, you must be wielding the item. Any effects are cumulative. For instance, if you wanted to make the ultimate fire sword, you could imbue the sword with fire from each of the magic, might, and technique paths. You would combine the fire damage and persistent fire damage from all three paths to determine the weapon's total effects, meaning you would eventually deal [[/r {5d10}[persistent,fire]]]{5d10} @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent fire Damage} on a critical hit!</p>\n<h2>Example of Imbuing</h2>\n<p>The party's level 7 fighter just refined a level 6 longsword out of tyrannosaurus parts (see @UUID[.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp#example-of-refining]{Example of Refining}). Realizing they could also imbue a property, they decided the only thing better than a tyrannosaurus tooth longsword is one that's on fire! Fortunately, the group recently defeated 2 magma scorpions, gaining 280 gp worth of parts. Since the magma scorpions have the fire trait or an attack or spell that deals fire damage (they have both!), the fighter imbues all the parts into their longsword, choosing to imbue the property of fire. The fighter has three choices of path for this imbued property and chooses the path of might. Imbuing 250 gp of parts increases the imbued property's level to 6 (the current maximum, since the item level of the longsword is 6), and lights the tyrannosaurus tooth longsword aflame, allowing it to deal 1d4 additional fire damage! The final weapon is a <em>+1 striking fire might (6) tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (6)</em> refined to 274 gp!</p>"},"_id":"HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33"}}},{"name":"Monster Parts Introduction","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>As the creature leapt from the tree, I called upon my tokens to put up a barrier between us, but it decided to spew fire at me instead.

The upgrades come in two major types-refinement improves the fundamental abilities of the item, and imbuing adds increasingly powerful special properties, which can sometimes branch along multiple paths. As weapons and armor become more refined, they can eventually be imbued multiple times, becoming truly fearsome armaments. In order to achieve these upgrades, the PCs need to defeat monsters with parts that meet the requirements for the refinement or imbuing.</p>\n<p>If you're a player, your next step is to check out the @UUID[.NGletTX69mXnptcw]{Quick Start Guide for PCs}, which will let you know what you need to do to use the new system.

Start by talking to your players to gauge interest and choosing the variant that's right for you. For more information, see @UUID[.ZPfYYoIRNtbBSHKX]{The Three variants}.</p>\n<h1>Step 2: Determine Monster Parts as Treasure</h1>\n<p>Once you know which variant you're using, you can start giving your PCs monster parts as treasure. It's most accurate to use @UUID[.yf9S7HMivMefgXCH]{Table 1A: Party Treasure by Level (Light Variant)}, @UUID[.LTknKePHeDQWhKGV]{Table 1B: Party Treasure by Level (Hybrid Variant)}, or @UUID[.cd1zRDDvOhb9m33Y]{Table 1C: Party Treasure by Level (Full Variant)} (depending on which variant you choose) to plan out monster part drops per level. You can also use @UUID[.4fEHHC8rPQ9QdQbs]{Table 2A: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Light Variant)}, @UUID[.obYR3VU6GlKETeaM]{Table 2B: Monster Parts gained Per Monster (Hybrid Variant)}, or @UUID[.ReyFC8M7eS2fuY3t]{Table 2C: Monster Parts Gained Per Monster (Full Variant)} to determine the value of parts that a given monster grants the PCs; this method is much more flexible, perfect for a sandbox campaign, but depending on if the group fights mostly single strong monsters or many weak monsters, it might distort wealth over time. Thus, you might want to occasionally keep an eye out to be sure the PCs don't have too much or too little. For more information, see @UUID[.nGuakGIOSVfMGSal]{Gathering Ingredients}.</p>\n<h1>Step 3: Communicate With Your Players</h1>\n<p>Ask your players what sorts of items and imbued properties they want to create, and you can use that to help them guide the story towards opponents that meet the necessary requirements. For instance, if one of the PCs is interested in creating a weapon imbued with electricity, you could give them a rumor when they Gather Information about a dungeon haunted by electric monsters. If you want to see the requirements for refining and imbuing for yourself, you can check out @UUID[.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp]{Refining} and @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}.</p>\n<h1>Step 4: Play the Game</h1>\n<p>Now all that's left is to play the game with the new system! As the PCs defeat monsters, the players will have their characters make decisions about how to use the parts they've found to upgrade their items. All you have to do is keep giving them more parts, using the appropriate tables to do so, and they'll do the rest. Continue to keep in mind what sorts of refining and imbuing your PCs are interested in pursuing so that you can make sure they have a chance to find the right sorts of monsters to accomplish their goals.</p>"},"_id":"SCYW1MiLRexo8EDM","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.SCYW1MiLRexo8EDM"}}},{"name":"Quick Start Guide for PCs","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>If your character is using the Monster Parts system from this book, you can use the following steps to create awesome items for yourself and your teammates out of monster parts.</em></p>\n<h1>Step 1: Slay Monsters</h1>\n<p>This part works like normal. Normally, you need to kill monsters before you can harvest their parts, though if your group is more peaceful, you might be able to find monster parts as quest rewards, or even unlock the powerful magical effects of monster parts freely given.</p>\n<h1>Step 2: Gather Ingredients</h1>\n<p>Next, you gather ingredients from the monsters you defeated. The GM will tell you how much value the monster parts have, as well as their Bulk. To prevent you from having to carry a lot of materials and keep track of them all, you might want to consider using them right away, but if not, you can hold onto them as long as you want. For more information, see @UUID[.nGuakGIOSVfMGSal]{Gathering Ingredients}. If you have plenty of downtime, you can try to get more total value of monster parts from a monster's corpse. For more information, see @UUID[.nGuakGIOSVfMGSal#gathering-more-from-monsters]{Gathering More from Monsters}.</p>\n<h1>Step 3: Refine Item</h1>\n<p>Refining an item with monster parts is the first step towards creating an awesome custom item with the parts you've found. During this step, you can either create the base mundane item from scratch by providing monster parts equal to its Price, or you can start with an existing mundane item. Once you've chosen the item, refine it to make it more powerful, using as many monster parts as you like, as long as they meet the item's refining requirements. For instance, you can refine a sword out of parts from a monster that had slashing or piercing unarmed attacks. As you reach certain threshold values while refining, your item will level up, increasing its item level and potentially gaining more benefits. You can't refine an item higher than your own level. For more information, see @UUID[.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp]{Refining}, and for an example, see @UUID[.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp#example-of-refining]{Example of Refining}.</p>\n<h1>Step 4: Imbue Item</h1>\n<p>Imbuing an item is where the item starts getting really interesting. As you continue to refine your item, the item eventually gains capacity to be imbued with special imbued properties. A few types of items can even eventually be imbued multiple times. Just like refining, you can imbue an item by using monster parts that meet the imbued property's requirements. For instance, if you want to imbue an item with fire, you'll need parts from a fire monster or a monster with fire abilities. Just like with refining, as you reach certain thresholds, the imbued property will level up, potentially granting increased benefits. You can't imbue a property on an item to be higher level than the item's own level. For more information, see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}, and for an example, see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33#example-of-imbuing]{Example of Imbuing}.</p>"},"_id":"NGletTX69mXnptcw","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.NGletTX69mXnptcw"}}},{"name":"Refining","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The first step in creating an item out of monster parts is refining the item. At its most basic level, refining monster parts into an item allows you to create a mundane weapon, armor, or shield out of those parts, as well as the basis for an item that will become a Perception item or skill item, like goggles or an anklet. This costs the normal amount for an item of that type. For instance, it would take 1 gp worth of parts to make a longsword, so you could slay a bulette and build a longsword out of its claws with plenty of materials to spare.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basics, refining upgrades an item's basic functionality and allows the item to be imbued with additional powers (See @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}). To refine an item, you first gather monster parts that meet the requirements listed in the item's refining entry and combine them into the item. You can't use this process on an item made from a particular material, since you're building and refining it out of monster parts, and you can't use this process on a magic item. A refined shield normally uses the statistics for a steel shield. Because items refined out of monster parts usually aren't metal, it bypasses a druid's restriction against wearing metal armor and shields, which offers a small but noticeable improvement for druids' survivability. If your group wishes to maintain the status quo for druids instead, limit druids to a base armor that wouldn't contain metal, and have their shields use the Hardness, HP, and BT thresholds listed for bucklers.</p>\n<p>It’s recommended that GMs allow characters to assign monster parts to refine or imbue items as soon as they collect the monster parts, and then gain the benefits of refining or imbuing during their next daily preparations without waiting to spend downtime. This keeps things simpler and allows for fast-paced games with plenty of monster part upgrades, and prevents the party from needing to track exactly which monster dropped which parts in what quantities over time.</p>\n<p>If the GM prefers, it can be part of the Craft activity using downtime instead. This choice makes a big difference in the value of Crafting in your game. For groups using the Craft activity, Crafting could become mandatory for multiple characters in the group to max out. By contrast, for groups using refinement during daily preparations, particularly those using the Full variant, Crafting is less valuable than it is in a normal game. Discuss with your group and make the decision that works best for the story and pacing you want to tell.</p>\n<p>If your party doesn't decide to use the monster parts right after gathering, it's good practice to record the type of monster the parts came from and their value (such as 45 gp worth of elite mimic parts). Later when you wish to refine or imbue a part that requires a specific type of monster ability, you can always reference the monster to ensure the monster parts can be used for your item.</p>\n<p>While there's no need to keep track of every monster that provided the parts you used to refine your items, you might want to consider noting particular powerful or memorable monsters whose parts you include in an item by changing the item's name to incorporate the monster's name, typically appended at the end. For instance, if you incorporated jabberwock parts in your greatsword, you might add \"of the jabberwock\" to the end of the item's name, or if you incorporated ancient red dragon parts, you might add \"of the crimson wyrm.\"</p>\n<h2>Refining Details</h2>\n<p>The five main categories of items you can refine are weapons, armor, shields, Perception items, and skill items. You can refine an item with monster parts, causing the item to increase in value. Refined items level up when the total value of monster parts used to refine them reaches set thresholds, and as you keep refining and leveling up your items, they grant additional benefits. Use @UUID[.9qpf9UNsviX8X5Ht]{Table 3A: Refinement Costs by Item Level (Weapons and Armor)}} and @UUID[.4XrJEFgodoqr5IvG]{Table 3B: Refinement Cost by Item Level (Shields, Perception Items, and Skill Items)} to determine the total value of monster parts needed to level up your items. Tables 4A through 4E list the benefits each type of item grants based upon its level. In addition to these specific benefits, increasing an item's level also increases your options when imbuing the item. You can't refine an item to a level above your character's level, but you can refine additional monster parts to an item to increase its value towards the next level. If you refine enough parts into an item in which your character level is the only limitation preventing it from leveling up, the item levels up as soon as your character does.</p>\n<h2>Salvaging and transferring</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you'll come across refined items during your travels. When you do, you typically have a decision to make: do you salvage the item, or decide to keep it and refine it further. Salvaging an item deconstructs the item into monster parts that can be used for refining or imbuing. However, salvaging can retrieve parts worth at most 50% of the cost of the item's refinement and imbued properties, similarly to selling an item but without the need to return to town and find a shop to use as an intermediary. For example, an axe with 100 gp of parts spent to refine it and 100 gp of parts spent to imbue a fire property has a total cost of 200 gp of parts. Salvaging would recover 100 gp of parts, 50 from each. These salvaged parts can be used for refinement or imbuing as normal.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you might find an item and want to keep its refinement and imbued properties but transfer to another item of the same type. For instance, a rogue might find a greatsword but want to transfer the refinement and imbue properties to a shortsword. To transfer the refinement value or an imbued property from one item of the same type (weapon, armor, shield, Perception item, or skill item) to another with lower value, first choose what to swap, either the refinement value or the value of one of the imbued properties. In order to successfully transfer refinement value, the two items must have compatible requirements for the type of monster parts they need. For instance, you couldn't transfer refinement from a bludgeoning weapon to a slashing weapon because they have different requirements. To perform the transfer, you'll need to provide additional monster parts worth 10% of the difference in values between the two. Finally, you swap the refinement or imbued property value between the two items.</p>\n<p>For our example rogue, if they had a <em>+1 striking cold might (4) rapier (6)</em> with a refinement value of 250 gp and an <em>imbued cold property (4)</em> with a value of 100 gp, and they wanted to transfer the refinement from a <em>+2 striking greatsword (10)</em> with a refinement value of 1,000 gp to the rapier, and keep the rapier's imbue property, they would calculate the difference in refinement value (1,000 gp - 250 gp = 750 gp), divide by 10 (for the additional 10%) to then provide 75 gp worth of monster parts to perform the transfer. With the transfer complete, the rapier would become a <em>+2 striking cold might (4) rapier (10)</em> and have a refinement value of 1,000 gp and the greatsword would become a <em>+1 striking greatsword (6)</em> would have a refinement value of 250 gp.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the barbarian insisted that instead of transferring the refinement value to the rapier, the group should transfer the cold imbued property onto the greatsword, the transfer would require 10 gp of parts (100 gp for the cold imbued property - 0 gp for the greatsword, divided by 10).</p>\n<h3>Refining and Imbuing Vs Runes</h3>\n<p>An item is either built and upgraded using this system or the normal rules for magic items with precious materials, fundamental runes, and property runes. Even in the light or hybrid versions, where magic weapons and armor using fundamental runes and property runes still exist, a single item can't use both at once.</p>\n<h2>Refining Weapons</h2>\n<p>To refine a weapon (or <em>handwraps of mighty blows</em>), you need monster parts from a monster with an unarmed attack that matches the weapon's physical damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). If a weapon has the versatile or modular traits, you can use monster parts from monsters with unarmed attacks matching any of the weapon's different damage types. Refining a weapon grants the following benefits, as shown on @UUID[.PDd7sAQ1GApl4LXZ]{Table 4A: Refinement Benefits by Level (Weapon)}}.</p>\n<p><strong>Item Bonus to Attack Rolls</strong> The weapon grants you the listed item bonus to attack rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Imbuing</strong> You can imbue the weapon up to the listed number of times (see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}).</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Damage Dice</strong> The weapon's damage dice increase to the listed amount of weapon damage dice. The italicized name is the equivalent fundamental rune, and you can use it as part of the weapon's name to make it more recognizable to a group used to the core magic item system (i.e. +2 greater striking longsword (12)).</p>\n<h2>Refining Weapons</h2>\n<p>You can use monster parts to refine a suit of armor or explorer's clothing. The monster must have suitable materials: hairs, fibers, or silk for explorer's clothing and padded armor, skin for leather and hide armors, or some sort of hard components like bones or horns for armor typically made of metal. Monsters lacking any sort of armored component, such as oozes, do not provide suitable components. Refining a suit of armor grants the following benefits, as shown on @UUID[.3BWwRohvETuT0mlj]{Table 4B: Refinement Benefits by Level (Amor)}. Just like magic armor created using the normal rules, refined armor has the invested trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased Item Bonus to AC</strong> The armor increases its item bonus to AC by the listed amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Imbuing</strong> You can imbue the armor up to the listed number of times (see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}).</p>\n<p><strong>Item Bonus to Saving Throws</strong> The armor grants the listed item bonus to all saving throws. The italicized name is the equivalent fundamental rune, and you can use it as part of the armor's name to make it more recognizable to a group used to the core magic item system (i.e. <em>+3 greater resilient leather armor (19))</em>.</p>\n<h2>Refining Shields</h2>\n<p>ou can typically use monster parts to refine a shield if the monster has Hardness, resistance to physical damage, or resistance to one of the three physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). In some cases, you and the GM might decide together that a monster with resistance to physical damage because it is amorphous or gaseous doesn't provide appropriate parts to refine a shield. Refining a shield grants the following benefits as shown on @UUID[.O0A32NQX89dUhCl6]{Table 4C: Refinement Benefits by Level (Shield)}. When refining a buckler, reduce the listed Hardness by 2, HP by 12, and BT by 6. You can't refine a tower shield in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Hardness</strong> The shield has the listed Hardness.</p>\n<p><strong>HP</strong> The shield has the listed number of Hit Points.</p>\n<p><strong>BT</strong> The shield has the listed Break Threshold.</p>\n<p><strong>Imbuing</strong> You can imbue the shield once, starting at level 4 (see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}).</p>\n<h2>Refining Perception Items</h2>\n<p>Perception items are worn magic items that enhance Perception, and you can refine them out of monsters with special senses. You can use monster parts to refine a Perception item if the monster has a special sense in its stat block other than low-light vision. Refining a Perception item grants the following benefits, as shown on @UUID[.tD9otautcyOJbCSV]{Table 4D: Refinement Benefits by Level (Perception Item)}. Perception items are worn items, and just like worn items created using the normal rules, refined Perception items have the invested trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Item Bonus to Perception</strong> The item grants the listed item bonus to Perception checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Imbuing</strong> You can imbue the Perception item once, starting at level 3 (see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}).</p>\n<h2>Refining Skill Items</h2>\n<p>Skill items refer to a category of worn magic items that enhance a specific skill, and you can refine them out of monsters good at that skill. You can use monster parts to refine a skill item if the monster has the skill listed in its stat block. Refining a skill item grants the following benefits, as shown on @UUID[.g8BTAnmoGQa9qC9a]{Table 4E: Refinement Benefits by Level (Skill Item)}. Skill items are worn items, and just like worn items created using the normal rules, refined skill items have the invested trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Item Bonus to Skill</strong> The item grants the listed item bonus to skill checks with its associated skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Imbuing</strong> You can imbue the skill item once, starting at level 3 (see @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33]{Imbuing}).</p>\n<h2>Example of Refining</h2>\n<p>The party's level 7 fighter recently lost their favorite weapon, and so they want to refine an amazing longsword out of the teeth of the tyrannosaurus they just defeated. They're playing using the hybrid variant and have 275 gp of tyrannosaurus parts. Although a tyrannosaurus doesn't have a slashing attack, longswords have the versatile piercing trait, which means the fighter can use the teeth to refine their longsword. They start the refinement by building the tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (0) for 1 gp, and then put the remaining 274 gp into the longsword's refinement. Next, they refine the sword and spend 250 gp, which means the fighter has refined the longsword to item level 6, and it gains the appropriate benefits: a +1 item bonus to hit, a second weapon damage die, and the ability to imbue an imbued property. The sword is now a <em>+1 striking longsword (6)</em>, with 24 gp of monster parts remaining. Finally, the fighter decides they want their longsword to reach level 7 as quickly as possible, so they apply the remaining 24 gp of monster parts to the longsword, which makes the final weapon a <em>+1 striking longsword (6)</em> refined to 274 gp-just 86 gp more of parts for the longsword to reach 7th level!</p>\n<p>In addition, the fighter is particularly excited about that imbued property, as the group also recently defeated 2 magma scorpions and now they have fiery plans for what comes next for their <em>+1 striking tyrannosaurus tooth longsword (6)</em> (to see the fighter's next steps, check out @UUID[.HTWMh9kv0ZSAab33#example-of-imbuing]{Example of Imbuing}).</p>"},"_id":"XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.XA5oNZMHPMnz7vPp"}}},{"name":"Table

Three variants","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Whether your group wants to use this system to replace all magic items, add it alongside magic items with minimum disruption, or do something in between, this system provides both guidelines and specific tables to make introducing monster parts as seamless as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Variant:</strong> With this option, the GM replaces all or nearly all wealth with this subsystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Variant:</strong> With this option, the GM replaces only currency with this subsystem. Other magic items still exist, even weapons and armor upgraded with runes as presented in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. This is easy to apply and has the flexibility of using plenty of magic items from other sources, but the disadvantage is that there won't be enough ingredients for more than a few items in the party to be built using this subsystem without being behind in item levels. So the party will likely have only a few refined items total, most likely with only moderate levels of imbuing.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the GM can simply add the Light variant without removing other rewards. This produces PCs who are a little more powerful in terms of gear than expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid Variant:</strong> This option is halfway between the other two; the GM replaces about half of permanent items, as well as currency, with this subsystem, while keeping the rest, as well as all consumables. Because this variant replaces half but not all the permanent items, this is the most difficult variant for a GM to apply to a pre-published adventure. However, it provides enough materials for the party to have an assortment of refined items while maintaining permanent and consumable magic items.</p>\n<h1>Identifying Monster Part Items</h1>\n<p>Items made of monster parts gain a magic of their own, and can be identified just like other magic items can. However, since this system deemphasizes the benefits of the Crafting skill, you might consider allowing the Crafting skill to identify all items built using the system, as a character with deep knowledge of the process of crafting and the use of different crafting components from various creatures might be able to use that to identify the effect of the finished product. This removes much of the value of the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.voYr7ygVcWmlg1f4]{Crafter's Appraisal} skill feat from the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em>, but it nonetheless could be a useful tweak to add more value to the Crafting skill in a game using the Monster Parts system, especially the full variant.</p>\n<h1>Investing Monster Part Items</h1>\n<p>Worn monster part items are invested in exactly the same way as any other invested item, and follow the same investiture limit of 10 invested items.</p>\n<h1>Naming Monster Part Items</h1>\n<p>This new system gives your group incredible flexibility for advancing your items in various ways, but as a result, there's more information you might need to know about an item than normally, as you and your players track the item's refining level and various imbued property levels. When necessary you can indicate the level of the weapon's various features in parentheses.</p>\n<p>For example, a <em>+3 major striking fire might (16) fire magic (18) cold technique (20) longsword (20)</em> is a magical longsword that has been refined to level 20 and has three imbued properties, fire might at level 16, fire magic at level 18, and cold technique at level 20. Most times you can abbreviate this name, or even just use a fanciful name based on the monsters whose parts you used to refine and imbue the item, such as \"Blade of the Dueling Frostflame Dragons.\"</p>\n<h1>Converting Your Game</h1>\n<p>As you read these new rules, you might be right in the middle of an ongoing campaign but excited to start using monster parts in your game right away. These tips will help you convert your game to the new system with minimum fuss.</p>\n<h2>LIGHT VARIANT</h2>\n<p>You might not need to do anything at all to convert to the light variant, since this variant assumes that only a few items are made of monster parts. Most likely, take the player or players most interested in having a monster part item or two aside and see if you want to convert any of their items using the tips from hybrid and full variants.</p>\n<h2>HYBRID OR FULL VARIANT</h2>\n<p>In the hybrid variant, many of the party's weapons, armor, shields, Perception items, and skill items will be using the new system, though perhaps not all. In the full variant, they all use the new system. In hybrid, it's easiest to try to convert whichever of those you can first and leave behind the items that are most obviously steeped in the base magic item system, such as specific magic items. In full variant, convert everything to a similar item. Here are some best practices for converting items.</p>\n<p>When converting a skill or Perception item, check to see if there's a refined and imbued version that works for you and convert to the nearest equivalent item. If not, and if you're using the hybrid variant, you can always keep the old item. For example, a <em>+1 shadow leather armor</em> could be converted into a <em>+1 leather armor (5)</em> and a <em>+1 Stealth skill item (3)</em>.</p>\n<p>When converting a shield, use the same process. Sturdy shields are simple to convert over, but you might not be able to convert over a special shield exactly, so in the hybrid variant you can just keep that shield.</p>\n<p>For weapons and armor, you should be able to convert fundamental runes to refining levels pretty easily. Many of the most popular weapon runes have a might path that does something similar, such as fire might working roughly similarly to flaming. For armor runes, there are fewer imbued properties to choose from, and the armor runes that grant skill bonuses you can just replace with a skill item, opening up two possible slots for imbued properties.</p>\n<p>If the PCs have a precious material item or a specific weapon like a staff or a flame tongue, consider leaving them as-is in the hybrid variant or else using the sidebar for the precious materials. You might even allow a specific item to be refined, but it should never be given imbued properties, and the refining level should not alter or adjust the effects of the specific item in any way.</p>"},"_id":"ZPfYYoIRNtbBSHKX","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.ZPfYYoIRNtbBSHKX"}}},{"name":"Variant: Automatic Bonus Progression and Imbuing","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>What if your campaign uses the automatic bonus progression subsystem? You can still use imbuing, replacing refining with the automatic bonus progression. This works in a simple way for weapons and armor: bonuses happen automatically per the automatic bonus progression rules. Use monster parts to imbue weapons and armor, gaining the ability to imbue the item at the same levels as normal on @UUID[.PDd7sAQ1GApl4LXZ]{Table 4A: Refinement Benefits by Level (Weapon)} and @UUID[.3BWwRohvETuT0mlj]{Table 4B: Refinement Benefits by Level (Amor)}.</p>\n<p>For shields, either use the normal refining and imbuing rules, or you might consider adding the shield refining rules as an \"automatic shield progression\" for 1 shield per character since those are the only items that have refinement and aren't part of the automatic bonus progression.</p>\n<p>For Perception and skill items, there's one decision you need to consider: imbued properties for skill items and Perception items are intentionally a much lower cost than imbued properties for weapons and armor, to encourage imbuing these items with additional abilities. This works in much the same way that skill and Perception items in the normal magic item rules have extra abilities built in, while weapons and armor only add abilities with property runes. With the automatic bonus progression, a character eventually receives six different skill potencies, but you probably don't want this to mean the character can gain up to six imbued properties allowing them cast six spells per day for not much more than the cost of six scrolls of the same spells. You can easily avoid this by disallowing imbuing of skill and Perception items, but for a middle ground, you might only allow one or two imbued skill items, increase the cost of imbuing these items to double the listed cost, or both. In any case, due to apex items being baked into automatic bonus progression, the apex imbued properties shouldn't be available.</p>"},"_id":"ZgcD3dwxiP7Dwn1i","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2262500,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cyX1wuOpmLKEd9WK.JournalEntryPage.ZgcD3dwxiP7Dwn1i"}}},{"name":"Variant: Precious Materials and Refining","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Normally a refined item is made out of various monster parts, and so it can't be made out of a precious item. However, it's possible that you might have a situation where you want to mimic the rules of a special material, perhaps for an item made entirely out of dragon scales, or for something made of extremely light monster parts that mimic the effects of mithral. In this case, choose which types of monsters provide parts that can create a special material item, for instance, dragons are a natural choice for the effects of dragonhide. A character can contribute monster parts towards the special material's effects in the same way as refining monster parts into a mundane item. Just like normal for items made out of precious materials, a low-grade precious material item can only be refined up to level 8, and a standard- grade precious material item can be refined up to level 15. A character can improve the grade of a precious material item from low to standard to high by providing an appropriate monster equal to the difference in price.</p>\n<p>Using a suit of dragonhide full plate as an example, a character could use 2,240 gp of dragon parts to create a standard-grade suit of dragonhide full plate. Later, to increase to a high-grade suit of dragonhide full plate, they would need to use a total of 44,800 gp of dragon parts.
