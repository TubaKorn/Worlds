{"name":"Create Token","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.TIG67Mjzz7w8YeUX"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You spend one minute creating a token from the fresh corpse of a creature your or your allies killed that had an innate spell. When you create a token, you learn what innate spells the creature possessed, if you didn't know already. Choose one of those innate spells to reside in the token. Write down the kind of monster, the spell, the tradition, and a quick description of the token's appearance. You can create a token of an innate spell of a level you are not yet able to cast, in anticipation of casting the spell later. Normally, you can only choose spells that are on one of the four traditions' spell lists, but your GM might choose to allow you to create a token from an innate spell that was originally a focus spell (in case you must cast it from your spell slots, rather than as a focus spell), or even a bespoke innate spell that appears only in the creature's innate spells. You can only create one token from a given corpse, even if the creature had more than one innate spell.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Battlezoo Bestiary"},"traits":{"value":["exploration"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:56.713-04:00","version":{"schema":0.684,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517336982,"modifiedTime":1663518051224,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1":3},"_id":"YUteSwXyhoAe63IN"}
