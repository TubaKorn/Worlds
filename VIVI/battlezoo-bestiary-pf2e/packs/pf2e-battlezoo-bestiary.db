The hag's unnatural essence twists such children into slavering monstrosities which serve the hag as guard beasts, hunters, and servants.</p>\n<p>A feld hag stands a head taller than most of her hag kin, towering over just about anyone unfortunate enough to see her in her true form. When the moon is full, a feld hag looms ominously in the pale moonlight, with pitted sallow skin and a vague, twisted grin. As the moon waxes and wanes, a feld hag's skin shifts as well, always matching the lunar body's color-from porcelain white during a full moon to ebon black at the beginning of a new lunar cycle. When the moon glows orange or red in the autumn, the feld hag's flesh likewise glows with bloody intensity. No matter the moon's phase, a feld hag can be easily identified by her burning fingers, which grip an electrifying whip that obeys only that hag, and the foul-smelling igneous secretions that slowly drip from her every pore.</p>\n<p>To covertly destroy crops and spread famine, feld hags transform into various nondescript animals like snakes, turtles, and frogs. However, even when a crop is destroyed, the feld hag's work is not yet done. A feld hag is rarely sated until she has feasted upon the raw flesh of a farmer's child or taken a brood to be pounded in her iron butter churn and fed to her dogs.</p>\n<h2>Fear of the Birch</h2>\n<p>Although feld hags thoroughly enjoy tossing their hag tar, they take particular delight in administrating pain with their horrific birch whip. In the hands of a feld hag, a simple birch stick transforms into a magical whip of incredible cruelty and suffering. Although others have tried to take this whip from a fallen feld hag, once dropped, the whip instantly transforms back into a simple branch.

They have a particular fondness for veins of molten rock, and are more prevalent in mountains with active volcanoes, where searing heat and incredible pressure hone their bodies into jagged weapons. Old obsidian shale beasts who have spent decades or even centuries near lava flows or magma veins can grow to incredible sizes and develop brutally sharp, extra-dense carapaces.</p>\n<p>Owing to their brittle and oblong bodies, obsidian shale beasts cannot curl up into protective balls like most shale spitters. Rather, obsidian shale beasts rely on their natural armor, which is as brittle and sharp as an obsidian blade, to protect them from inter-pack tussles, attacks from predators, and sudden cave-ins.</p>\n<h2>Noble \"Bards\"</h2>\n<p>A shale spitter pack with an obsidian shale beast among their numbers is far more likely to survive times of crisis. When an unmatchable predator like a cavern troll or cave worm attacks the pack, it's up to the obsidian shale beast to rally its kin to safety while fending off the intruder. The shale beast accomplishes this with its unique ability to produce a subsonic hum that snaps other shale spitters out of torpors and drives them to action. Shale beasts are also unusually noble, and will stay behind to distract an attacker if doing so will enable its pack mates to escape.</p>\n<h2>Shale Spitter</h2>\n<p>Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers.

Wizards sometimes populate their towers with knotsmen, seeing them as relatively cheaper to construct and maintain than complicated golems. Witches, thieves' guilds, and even traveling circuses have been known to employ knotsmen as well.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem cost effective in the short term, knotsmen's bizarre intellect (if it can be called \"intellect\") makes these creatures unreliable&mdash;or, at least, somewhat unpredictable&mdash;minions. Knotsmen understand the language of their creator and can execute simple or complex orders with ease, but they have a tendency to take liberties with vaguely stated commands, lingering in villages and countryside alike as suits their whims. Combined with their ability to slither along floors and through cracked doorways unnoticed, knotsmen's precociousness often ends up more of a liability than a boon.</p>\n<p>Knotsmen are terrifyingly sturdy and rarely fall apart even after years of use; the magic that animates a knotsman also enables it to tie and re-tie even the most frayed fibers of its body. When its creator dies, a knotsman invariably strikes out on its own, wandering further and further from its home until it finds a new master. Despite their whimsy, knotsmen want, more than anything, to be of use. Would- be masters best beware, though&mdash;a knotsman commanded to perform tasks at odds with its innate personality might just as quickly lash out in a merciless rage.</p>\n<h2>The Rope Remembers</h2>\n<p>Though they lack true intelligence, knotsmen boast curious personalities. A knotsman's disposition generally reflects the type of rope used to create it; for example, a knotsman made of ship's rigging might serve its captain faithfully, while one woven from a hangman's noose could be as treacherous as the criminal that once swung from it.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Knotsman Creature 7 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 45/100/180 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, dexterity, energy resistant (negative, positive), sensory (darkvision), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["construct","mindless"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common"],"selected":[],"custom":"(Can't Speak Any Language)"},"di":{"value":["bleed","death-effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"fire","value":5},{"type":"slashing","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:33.992-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Knotsman","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/knotsman_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316680,"modifiedTime":1663517460507,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Colorful and vibrant as a macaw but large and ferocious as a bear, the beast's closest approximation is the equally enigmatic owlbear. In fact, these creatures are so similar that it is largely thought that the parrotbear is the work of a copycat wizard who sought to put their own spin on the infamous strigine monster. Others speculate that the parrotbear may be some practical joke of the gods or simply an owlbear-adjacent evolutionary offshoot.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its superficial similarities to the owlbear, the parrotbear boasts its own particular set of special skills and powers. Most notably, parrotbears can mimic voices, an ability they use to confound prey and predators alike, which gives them an outsize reputation for having a particularly wicked sense of humor, despite their clearly avian-level intellect. While parrotbears are arguably smarter than their owlbear kin, their ability to \"speak\" is not a sign of intelligence, and the nonsensical nature of their utterances becomes evident as one gets closer to the source of the babble.</p>\n<p>Like owlbears, parrotbears are omnivores that favor meat whenever they can get it. A parrotbear's typical hunting tactics involve imitating the bark of a lost pet or the cries of a recently \"disappeared\" individual to lure loved ones into the parrotbear's jungle hunting grounds.</p>\n<h2>Parrotbear Locations</h2>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, parrotbears are rarely found in the jungles south of the equator, where long-established apex predators easily outcompete them for food. Instead, they seem most prevalent among the outskirts of major metropolitan cities, where so many wizards' mad experiments often end up. Parrotbears even seem to get along with the owlbears who share their hunting territories; in fact, the two species' natural abilities compliment one another nicely, making such pairings especially dangerous.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Parrotbear Creature 4 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 12/27/50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, slashing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), mental, sensory (low-light vision, scent), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.013-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Parrotbear","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/parrotbear_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316683,"modifiedTime":1663517460511,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Such is the case for wispy wayfarers, whose essence is infused with the suffocating violence of the maelstrom that swallowed up its living body. Adventurers looking for forgotten bounties aboard a sunken or beached shipwreck would do well to watch out for this ghastly warden.</p>\n<p>Wispy wayfarers generally guard a shipwreck alongside sturdier corporeal undead such as draugr. They prefer not to announce their presence, perhaps hiding in plain sight as a ragged cloak strewn over a cobwebbed stair rail. Once battle is joined, they take advantage of their ability to pass through walls and floors to creep up on and silence any spellcasters, especially clerics and champions. Because their own last words were lost in the raging wind and rain of a terrible storm, nothing disturbs a wispy wayfarer more than mortal prayers. From afar a wayfarer is hauntingly silent, though upon approaching the thing one can hear a soft howl, as of distant winds.</p>\n<p>A wispy wayfarer resembles a humanoid skull missing its lower jaw and with coins over its eye sockets. The skull hovers above the animated tatters of an old canvas sailcloth draped over a disembodied ship mast. The sail flaps in a slow-motion fury, even when there is no wind present, as though constantly remembering the storm that sent it to its doom.</p>\n<h2>Easy Loot</h2>\n<p>A wispy wayfarer's raging soul can be quieted only once all the treasure aboard its ship is removed&mdash;a challenge most adventuring parties wholeheartedly welcome. However, if even one copper piece remains aboard its ship, the wayfarer will continue to manifest, stubborn to the end.</p>\n<h2>Sitebound Spirit</h2>\n<p>When a mass tragedy like a shipwreck or theatre fire claims the lives of sailors, performers, or other inhabitants whose identities were inextricably tied to the vessel or building in which they perished, the end result is often a malevolent spirit such as a wispy wayfarer. These ghostly beings cling to the Material Plane with a vengeance, assuming billowy shapes that reflect the trappings of their sacred place of work.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Wispy Wayfarer Creature 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 5/12/22 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Deception, Lore [Sailing], Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, dexterity, energy resistant (acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, sonic), evil, negative, sensory (darkvision), wild, winged</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["incorporeal","spirit","undead"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["death-effects","disease","paralyzed","poison","sleep","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"all","value":5,"exceptions":"except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical"}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.035-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-5},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":4,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Wispy Wayfarer","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/wispy_wayfarer_token.webp","scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316686,"modifiedTime":1663517460512,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

much larger size. Upon closer examination, the differences become obvious and terrifying. Glowing red eyes filled with hate squint over a snarling, acid-coated maw dominated by two incisors the size of daggers. A thick, leathery tail covered in jagged barbs extends from the back of a stocky frame which is up to 8 feet long and can weigh over 300 pounds.</p>\n<p>Prevailing wisdom suggests that evil druids created reaver beavers as a weapon to unleash upon settlers and despoilers of nature, but no one can claim to know the monsters' origins for certain. What is known for sure is that reaver beavers possess a malicious intellect entirely out of line with their animalistic forebears and that they are driven to terrorize anyone who encroaches upon their domain. Hunters, farmers, and miners are all often targets of their predations. Reaver beavers seem to harbor a specific hatred for lumberjacks; often the first signs of a nearby colony of reaver beavers are the remains of a destroyed lumber camp or sawmill. Survivors who can speak of the assault are rare, but the monsters' grisly tendency to gnaw off their victims' legs and leave the shredded appendages behind leave little doubt as to the culprits.</p>\n<p>Reaver beavers are equally as industrious as normal beavers, but, in a perverse echo of their natural kin, they favor not wood as their primary building material but rather the bodies of their victims. Horrific \"corpse dams\" upriver from settlements can obstruct the flow of water as well as befoul it with disease. Reaver beavers' colonies are constructed in the same way, often supplementing humanoid corpses with those of other animals to create obscene mounds of rotting flesh. These gruesome dens are usually built near the shore of a lake and extend underneath the surface, with the entrance accessible only by diving beneath the fetid water.</p>\n<h2>Reaver Beaver Tactics</h2>\n<p>In combat, reaver beavers unleash volleys of acidic spittle before swarming forward in an ungainly rush.

These insects are poisonous black locusts native to the Shadow Plane, bound together in humanoid shape with powerful unholy magic.</p>\n<p>Once summoned, a swarm assassin awaits orders from its summoner and carries out its duties to the best of its ability. Swarm assassins remain on the Material Plane until their orders are completed or for one moon cycle, whichever comes first. Once back on the Shadow Plane, a swarm assassin discorporates into a humming mass of bugs that skitter to the plane's dark corners.</p>\n<p>Evil wizards occasionally summon swarm assassins to serve as their bodyguards, but more often, vile clerics summon these fiendish servants to deal with heretics or enemies of their order. Swarm assassins excel at tracking down their targets and typically do so under cover of night. They avoid civilized areas, though their basic level of intellect allows them to interact with unsuspecting individuals when necessary.

They are most often encountered in libraries, academies, and other places of higher learning, where they are understandably mistaken at first glance for violent ghosts or other spirits. To the contrary, skotogelias are peaceful and bookish researchers who are only too happy to help a fellow lover of knowledge or bibliophile.</p>\n<p>Skotogelias eschew the capricious and oft-frivolous lifestyles of most of their fey brethren, instead single-mindedly focusing their efforts on researching and preserving lore about a particular area of study. They follow, examine, and catalog everything they can about their subject of choice. To organize and preserve their research, skotogelias maintain vast libraries in the fey realm using a magical umbral script scrawled in the shadows of the ever-shifting towering trees, rolling hills, and spinning lakes of their native plane. Of course, skotogelias recognize that not every creature is fluent in their incredibly complex written language. So they often make copies of their findings in more common tongues, then disperse such scrolls and tomes by leaving them in the nooks and crannies of libraries all over the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>Skotogelias do realize that some knowledge is best kept under wraps or at least not freely dispersed. If a book or resource seems particularly dangerous, a skotogelia is apt to secret it somewhere on the fey realm, logging the forbidden lore's exact location only in the fortified lockbox of the skotogelia's own mind. Wily skotogelias have, however, been known to occasionally leave clues or tracks to such dangerous documents in places where a skilled and knowledgeable creature might be able to find them; such trails of clues are the skotogelia's \"test\" to determine if a being is worthy of bearing such powerful knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Guardians of Lore</h2>\n<p>Though skotogelias are best known for their sheer studiousness and peaceful bookkeeping, there is no quicker way to rouse a skotogelia's ire than by threatening the library in which they dwell.

Tragically, when destruction visits the establishment in the form of riotous mobs or belligerent arsonists, these same workers are also among the most likely to perish in the attack.

The creator finds or summons a large number of tiny animals&mdash;typically lizards, mice, and other minute reptiles and mammals&mdash;then enacts a ritual that ensorcells them into acting as a single large predatory beast. The ritual is completed when the enchanted swarm is sealed into a skin vessel of some kind. This vessel can be as simple as a rough sack vaguely shaped like a four-legged creature, as ornate as a lifelike plush toy, or even simply the preserved hide of a bear or great cat. No matter the vessel's appearance, the swarm animates it ably, and the mogadb serves its master unerringly.</p>\n<p>While it has no central intelligence, a mogadb's constituent swarm nonetheless behaves like a single beast, prowling about on four \"legs\" and attacking with its limbs like a large quadruped, though it has a discernible boneless quality to its movement. Impacts cause the mogadb's skin to ripple, and the swarm inside is visible whenever the creature opens its mouth to feed or exhale vermin at foes. As the mogadb becomes damaged, rents and tears in the skin vessel reveal the writhing horde within, acting in eerie concert.</p>\n<p>Many adventurers mistake mogadbs for animated objects or other types of magical construct creatures or occasionally even magic items like <em>bags of holding</em>. Trickster fey such as gremlins take great joy in such antics and craft their mogadbs with this exact goal in mind.</p>\n<p>Particularly cruel fey have been known to craft whole packs of mogadbs, even riding them as war beasts, in the process totally draining an area of tiny animals to feed their rituals.

All the while, dark incantations are chanted and snake blood is poured onto the sacrifice's lacerations. These rites strip the creature of its sentience and transform it into a mindless abomination.</p>\n<p>A venomous snakedead retains its humanoid body but shows clear signs of its fate. Its body is covered in bite marks and its veins swell with stagnant black, green, and purple fluids. The eyes of a venomous snakedead have a similarly black, green, or purple hue to them. Its mouth sports fangs dripping with venom, but most telling of all is the creature's sinewy neck, lengthened in the process of the creation rites and imbued with necromantic strength.</p>\n<p>While a venomous snakedead is a mindless creature and, as such, does not have a sense of society, the arcane magic used to create it binds the creature to others of its kind. If its creator is killed or willingly releases the venomous snakedead, it will naturally be drawn to other snakedead. It is not unheard of for venomous snakedead to gather in large groups or even hordes, and witnesses of such phenomena speak of the beings' hivemind-like behavior and the display of their own unique profane rituals. What, exactly, these rituals accomplish is anyone's guess.</p>\n<p>It is said that venomous snakedead were first created by a coven of witches serving strange serpentine demons. The witches sought to create a creature in their patrons' image, a creature that would do the witches' bidding in the mortal realm. They were more successful than they had dared hope, for the snakedead shared a mystical connection not only with the divine, but with other snakedead.

Nearly all zuggles share the same basic form, which resembles a large caterpillar or wood weevil made of elemental matter. Each zuggle has a central fin along its backside that expands to detect and absorb ambient elemental auras. Other than its fin, the body of a zuggle can vary greatly depending on what type of elemental aura it has recently absorbed. A zuggle on the Plane of Water might have fins and gills, whereas a zuggle on the Plane of Earth might have a rocky carapace and claws. Elsewhere in the multiverse, zuggles can be found trying to feed off of any elemental auras that they can get. In places suffused with all kinds of elemental magic, a zuggle might have a truly bizarre anatomy and might have any number of unique abilities.</p>\n<p>While they aren't friendly by any means, zuggles are curious in a way that is often mistaken for an endearing disposition. It is not uncommon for a zuggle to follow around a spellcaster and sup up any spilled elemental byproducts from cast spells. A starving zuggle might display erratic behavior or aggression when it finally comes upon a source of elemental power. There have even been a few instances of a starving zuggle exploding after feasting too quickly on a potent elemental source.</p>\n<h2>Zuggle Orbs</h2>\n<p>Zuggles naturally produce fist-sized globules of element-infused protein, which they store in specialized pouches that run the length of their spine near their fin.

It looks wary and ready for a fight, and its horns and hooves shine like polished metal.</p>\n<p>In the wild places where the ancient breed of cattle known as aurochs roam, there are those specimens that, whether through magical accident, fate, or manipulation, develop to be even wilder, stronger, and deadlier than their already formidable kin, with powers over the very elements of the natural world. These extraordinary aurochs become legendary and prized among those who hunt such creatures for meat, leather, or sport or those who seek to tame such wild beasts. The strange markings that develop along their hides have given these creatures the name \"runebranded aurochs,\" though other colorful names exist as well, such as elemental aurochs, storm cattle, and lightning bulls.</p>\n<p>While a skinned runebranded aurochs can provide strong leather suitable for crafting, the rune markings on its hide rarely possess any lasting magic after the creature's death. Only the most powerful or eldest runebranded aurochs&mdash;those who have thrived in the wilds for an exceptionally long time or were otherwise subject to excessive whims of destiny&mdash;might bear runes on their hides capable of being transferred to weapons or armor. Such aurochs are apt to develop even stranger abilities such as magical flight, total immunity to their element, and even advanced size and intellect.</p>\n<h2>Rarer Breeds</h2>\n<p>The runebranded aurochs presented here was created by a magically charged storm or some other electrical process. Although this is a common form of the animal, other sources can make runebranded aurochs attuned instead to fire, cold, or more exotic elements. Such aurochs possess similar abilities, but their attacks and resistances are of a different energy type.</p>\n<h2>Unbreakable</h2>\n<p>A runebranded aurochs will rarely take a rider or do domesticated work willingly. Beastmasters may find means by which to keep such animals for show or as particularly brutish guard beasts, but runebranded aurochs will always try to break free in order to seek the wilds and other aurochs.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Runebranded Aurochs Creature 4 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 12/27/50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Athletics)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, electricity, energy resistant (electricity, positive), sensory (low-light vision, scent), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"electricity","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[],"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.354-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":15,"saveDetail":"","base":15},"reflex":{"value":10,"saveDetail":"","base":10},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":"","base":9}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Runebranded Aurochs","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/runebranded_aurochs_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316731,"modifiedTime":1663517460538,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Adkins"},"creatureType":"","blurb":"","publicNotes":"<p>Salt gliders loom high overhead in pale desert skies, acting as the far-seeing eyes of their salt stalker packs. Experienced desert travelers recognize a salt glider as the herald of an impending salt stalker attack. In most cases, the mere sight of a salt glider indicates that it may already be too late.</p>\n<p>Whereas salt stalkers already have eerily thin, membranous hides, salt gliders take this attribute to its extreme. With their insectile wings, spindly legs, and bulging red eyes, one could be forgiven for mistaking a distant salt glider for an oversized mosquito or flying termite. Up close, however, a salt glider leaves little doubt as to its relation, however warped or monstrous, to its similarly alien salt stalker kin.</p>\n<p>On land, salt gliders can roll up their wings into tight tubes and balance on them to walk about like grotesque stilts. Nevertheless, their long, clumsy torsos makes land-based movement difficult, so salt gliders almost always choose to fly. This same torso is light and flexible enough that salt gliders can whip their spines up to twice as far as other salt stalkers&mdash;a tactic they make frequent use of as they harry their prey from above.</p>\n<p>Salt gliders' usefulness toward their pack extends beyond just combat. Tiny filaments on their wings allow gliders to detect changes in weather patterns with incredible accuracy, and they relay this information to their kin with sharp, rasping barks. A salt glider flies for cover at the merest hint of encroaching rain or sandstorm. Canny desert wanderers who spot salt gliders on the retreat can reliably bet that foul weather is just over the horizon.</p>\n<h2>Air Drops</h2>\n<p>In mixed hunting packs, salt gliders famously enjoy lifting and carrying their pack mates across the battlefield, though they can only do so for short distances. This ability dramatically enhances the maneuverability of all salt stalkers involved and enables the pack to conduct harrowing surprise attacks.</p>\n<h2>Salt Stalker</h2>\n<p>Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.</p>\n<p>Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Salt Glider Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), poison, wild, winged, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"senses":{"value":"fluidsense (imprecise) (1 mile), rainsense"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.390-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":5},"cha":{"mod":-2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Salt Glider","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/salt_glider_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316736,"modifiedTime":1663517460540,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Believed to be formed from the corrupted souls of those who died in horrific fires, these so-called ash eaters seek opportunities and places where their flames can cause tragic and irreplaceable damage. Fields ready for the harvest, crowded tenement buildings, and busy libraries are favored targets for an ardeodaemon's arson. If left to their own devices, ardeodaemons scout out their targets for days before acting, finding the best ways to maximize the consequences of a single spark or a concentrated blaze. When not pursuing arson for arson's sake, ardeodaemons seek out stronger creatures with fire abilities whom they can serve, though always with the hopes of steering their masters toward their own destructive goals.</p>\n<p>Ardeodaemons avoid confrontation if possible, preferring to set fires with their burning resin, stoke the flames long enough that doom is assured, then watch the conflagration from afar.

It was made, so the legend goes, by a desperate community whose corrupt leadership had long denied its people justice for some ancient crime. The scavengers of the community collected scrap metal and trinkets of better times, then fused everything to create a construct that would uncover ample evidence of the ancient crime and force the leaders to acknowledge their atrocities. Yet, the leaders managed to steal the dredgenaut and use the powerful construct to track down its creators. The screams of these talented inventors could be heard for miles around. And so it was that the secrets of creating dredgenauts were revealed to all.</p>\n<p>A dredgenaut is a powerful construct made of scrap metal and fueled by arcane toxic runoff. Powerful nations and private companies use dredgenauts to trawl for criminal evidence-either their enemies' or their own-in battlefields and ruined cities. To collect evidence, the dredgenaut picks up noteworthy items or creatures and drops them into the aperture on its face, \"swallowing\" them for later deposit. For reasons not entirely understood, dredgenauts are particularly prone to collecting supernatural or psychically resonant evidence that, when destroyed, can have dramatic aging effects on nearby living creatures.</p>\n<h2>Desperate Measures</h2>\n<p>Though its primary objective is to gather evidence, sometimes a dredgenaut must temporarily forego this mission in order to ensure its own safety. By reconfiguring various internal gears and tubes, the dredgenaut can funnel collected evidence from its storage compartments into its engine core, causing the engine to overheat as magic items, trapped spirits, and other occult phenomena break down in the construct's body. The dredgenaut can then release this excess energy either via a \"chrono beam\" from its face or by venting the energy from its body in a sudden burst.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Dredgenaut Creature 14 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 560/1,250/2,300 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, slashing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (negative, positive), fire, mental, sensory (greater darkvision, true seeing), spells (Arcane: locate, prying eye, retrocognition, true seeing, vibrant pattern), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["construct","mindless"],"senses":{"value":"greater darkvision, true seeing"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed","death-effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","value":15,"exceptions":"except adamantine"}],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.442-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":8},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":28,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":3,"width":3,"disposition":-1,"name":"Dredgenaut","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/dredgenaut_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316747,"modifiedTime":1663517460545,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

In fact, however, this unsightly creature is a naturally occurring airborne fungus that grows in the shape of a bird of prey.</p>\n<p>Somehow, fungal raptors have gained enough intelligence to imitate the forms of their namesake flying predators. Packs of fungal raptors hunt dark forests and damp swamps, using their diseased wings to drive prey deeper into their territory by creating a maze of pestilence. Once a target is thoroughly disoriented and lost, the fungal raptors ambush their prey, infect their victim with a unique blood-devouring disease, and then retreat into the trees where they wait for their helpless victims to succumb to exsanguination. Like true carrion feeders, fungal raptors never eat live prey, but even more importantly, fresh blood itself is harmful to fungal raptors-a fact desperate defenders might try to use to their advantage.</p>\n<p>Like most fungi, fungal raptors blossom and grow in dank, dimly lit areas such as dungeons, grottos, and ruins, making them a common threat to spelunkers and treasure-hunting adventurers. In addition, territorial druids sometimes purposefully cultivate fungal raptors to protect their primal demesnes.</p>\n<h2>Spore Carriers</h2>\n<p>The first fungal raptors were created by a vampiric druid obsessed with the cycle of rot, decay, and rebirth (particularly the rot and decay parts). Since then, fungal raptors have spread throughout the known world utilizing sporal reproduction.

These brokenhearted, twisted guardians of the trees go on to sow the same kinds of despair they felt upon seeing their home so ravaged.</p>\n<p>Whereas most arboreals attack only creatures whose aims are incompatible with the prosperity of the forest, such as loggers and invading warmongers, arboreal husks are not so picky when it comes to choosing foes. To these husks, all living creatures are potential despoilers of nature, from an elven druid \"experimenting\" on plants with her nourishing primal magic to the lowly squirrel \"stealing\" acorns for the winter. No amount of reason or charm can sway an arboreal husk from the basic assumption that anyone in its vicinity means harm to it and its ruined domain.</p>\n<p>Some arboreals have tried to revert their disturbed husk relatives to their original goodly natures, though so far none have succeeded. An arboreal husk rooted in a healthy forest doesn't recover&mdash;in fact, the opposite occurs, as the forest around the husk wilts and dies in its ruinous presence. Thus, untainted arboreals have no choice but to slay their twisted siblings. Rather than hunt down and destroy known husks in their territory, arboreals often choose to hire adventurers to take on this terrible task.</p>\n<p>The arboreal husk presented here is of an arboreal regent.</p>\n<h2>Guardians of Nothing</h2>\n<p>If an arboreal is typically the guardian of a forest, then what do arboreal husks protect? The answer is at the root of the existential crisis that causes such husks to exist in the first place: nothing. Some woodland sages insist that all husks, including arboreal husks, can be redeemed if placed within a flourishing natural realm. But husks themselves blanch at the thought and seem to revel in their despair. If there is any validity to this claim, then the act of transplanting a husk into a new home must be undertaken necessarily by force.</p>\n<h2>Husk</h2>\n<p>Plant creatures share a special bond with the natural world that few other beings can completely understand or appreciate. When the bond to its realm is broken or severed, a sentient plant creature's rage can transform it into a terrible shadow of its former self. Benign and even friendly plants like leshies, arboreals, and dryads all run the risk of this horrible metamorphosis, though their own agony often pales in comparison to the horrors which they inflict on their victims. Lonely, angry, and twisted, plant husks sow their monstrous madness in the fertile corpses of wanderers who dare travel through the husk's blighted swath of wilderness. Though in their eyes any living creature is worthy of obliteration, husks reserve their most horrendous punishments for any litterer, land settler, or lumberjack who ever dared to desecrate, dominate, or denude the forest.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Arboreal Husk Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (light, medium), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, chaotic, constitution, energy resistant (positive), evil, mental, sensory (darkvision), spells (Primal: speak with plants), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_husk","plant"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["arboreal","common","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":"Speak with Plants"},"di":{"value":["emotion"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"bludgeoning","value":5,"exceptions":""},{"type":"piercing","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"axe","value":5},{"type":"fire","value":10}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.503-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":3,"width":3,"disposition":-1,"name":"Arboreal Husk","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/arboreal_husk_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316757,"modifiedTime":1663517460550,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

In its bud form, an iron fern secretes an acid that dissolves stone and earth, allowing the plant's roots to sup upon the exposed trace minerals and ores. As the bud sprouts its first fiddlehead, its leaves become coated in whatever metal it has absorbed, forming a kind of protective sheath around the soft plant matter. Because there are as many different types of iron fern as there are metals, the plant's name is something of a misnomer; the most common varieties of iron fern are, in fact, copper, tin, and nickel ferns. Conversely, rare varieties such as gold and platinum ferns are highly prized among botanists and treasure hunters alike.</p>\n<p>However, iron ferns are as hazardous as they are valuable. The plant's hormones are similar to a flytrap, allowing it to mindlessly swat at would-be predators with its razor-sharp leaves. Miners and spelunkers take great care in caves populated by iron ferns; serrated metal leaves can drop from tunnel ceilings onto unsuspecting workers or slash at their feet from within cracked rock faces. Some mining companies employ specially trained rust monsters to clear out iron ferns in advance, though the dangers of a well-fed rust monster are only slightly less daunting than those of an iron fern forest.</p>\n<p>Like other ferns, iron ferns reproduce via spores. However, iron ferns' spores are no mundane plant matter. Rather, these spores manifest as clouds of metal shavings extremely dangerous to the eyes and lungs of any creature unlucky enough to wander by. Conveniently for the iron fern, the corpse of a spore-slain animal makes for an extremely fertile germination medium.</p>\n<p>As mindless plants, iron ferns are incapable of ill will, though this doesn't stop many living creatures from openly despising these ferrous flora. For those willing to risk a few cuts, though, iron ferns promise many potential riches, from mundane animal hides to spilled gold and magic items.</p>\n<h2>Lucky Leaf</h2>\n<p>Despite their dangerous leaves and spores, iron ferns are often regarded as a sign of good luck, particularly when sighted outside of a mine or cave. The presence of this plant, so the thinking goes, indicates that rich metal veins may be hidden just beneath the earth's surface.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Iron Fern Creature 2 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 5/12/22 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (fire, positive), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["mindless","plant"],"senses":{"value":"no vision, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["mental"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"fire","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.575-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Iron Fern","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/iron_fern_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316766,"modifiedTime":1663517460555,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Wide, heavy, and thin, a shinglelurk's tough, rubbery body blends seamlessly with common roofing materials such as stone, slate, and tile. Shinglelurks wait on such roofs for unsuspecting prey to traipse over them, then strike with deadly speed and efficiency.</p>\n<p>The first shinglelurks were created by spellcasting urbanites who sought to devise a camouflaged solution for home defense. These wizards experimented on cloakers, mimics, and ochre jellies to create their ideal monstrous defender. In the process, they released untold numbers of specimens into the city before ultimately creating the hybrid known as the shinglelurk.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, a bold landowner might lure a shinglelurk onto their property with the hopes the creature will take up residence. Without magical coercion, such landowners find the erratic-minded shinglelurk an unreliable partner. Thankfully, a shinglelurk tends to leave its hunting ground once it has devoured a burglar or two or otherwise compromised its hiding spot.</p>\n<h2>Last Ditch Dive</h2>\n<p>Shinglelurks have strong self-preservation instincts, matched only by their dedication to the kill. If a shinglelurk has one or more creatures enveloped in its body, it might risk injury by intentionally falling off a roof or other high place and smashing into the street below, relying on its tough, spongy hide to survive the impact while disabling its prey.</p>\n<h2>Solitary Reproduction</h2>\n<p>Shinglelurks are solitary and territorial monsters, and their violent disposition extends to members of their own kind as well. They do not form bonds or even mate. Rather, upon reaching a certain age and size, a shinglelurk will molt and bud, producing two offspring before dying. The offspring quickly grow to adulthood and strike out on their own, repeating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Shinglelurk Creature 7 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 45/100/180 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (medium, heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> acid, bane, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild, winged</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["aberration"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":["common"],"selected":[],"custom":"(Can't Speak Any Language)"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"bludgeoning","value":10,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"piercing","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[],"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.594-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":"","base":17},"reflex":{"value":18,"saveDetail":"","base":18},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":"","base":13}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":3,"width":3,"disposition":-1,"name":"Shinglelurk","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/shinglelurk_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316768,"modifiedTime":1663517460556,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

So-called jungle mantis swarms include mantises of extraordinary size&mdash;the longest specimens are up to 1 foot long&mdash;with thick exoskeletons and serrated tibial spines.</p>\n<p>It's these extra little claws on the ends of their already sharp limbs that set jungle mantises apart from garden variety mantids. When they combine their strength as a swarm, jungle mantises can grip, hold, and drag entire animals, up to and including large mammals. Though jungle mantis swarms thankfully cannot haul their prey up into the sky, the sight of an ally being dragged into the dark jungle undergrowth is shocking enough to keep most skittish explorers on edge.</p>\n<p>Equally alarming are a jungle mantis swarm's surprisingly cunning tactics. Jungle mantises know better than to stay put when their prey puts up a fight, and so they constantly bob and weave among nearby flora. They've even been known to set up ambushes, separate packs of creatures from one another, and pick out weaker-looking or injured targets when confronting a group. Locals say that the behavior of a jungle mantis swarm is less like a group of wild insects and more like a mobile colony, though there doesn't seem to be a \"queen\" as an ant colony would have. Rather, jungle mantises operate as a finely tuned society of equal-minded&mdash;and equally voracious&mdash;carnivores.</p>\n<p>Large and dangerous as the most well-known jungle mantis swarms are, rumors persist of even larger mantis swarms: flying apocalypses of dozens of towering giant mantids, capable of destroying entire settlements in an evening.</p>\n<h2>Mantis Swarm Companions</h2>\n<p>Some jungle-dwelling druids have made attempts to domesticate individual jungle mantises or rehabilitate small groups of insects that have become separated from their swarm. With enough training, a small group can be nurtured into a swarm of mantises and seem to have just enough intelligence to serve as a druid or ranger's animal companion. Many hopeful mantis- lovers have delved into the jungle specifically to acquire and tame such a swarm, though far fewer succeed in the endeavor.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Jungle Mantis Swarm Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), fortification, sensory (darkvision), strength, wild, winged</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","swarm"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["precision","swarm-mind"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"bludgeoning","value":4,"exceptions":""},{"type":"piercing","value":8,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":8,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"area-damage","value":8},{"type":"splash-damage","value":8}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.636-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Jungle Mantis Swarm","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/jungle_mantis_swarm_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316775,"modifiedTime":1663517460559,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

By assuming the form of different mortal creatures' shadows, a shadow thief could infiltrate society via progressively more important figures. At least, this was their creators' intention. However, as the first shadow thieves traveled through the vastness of space, they lost their connection to their elder creators&mdash;but not their interest in the societies of mortals. Now they wander the planet with their own mysterious designs in mind.</p>\n<h2>Willing Hosts</h2>\n<p>The experience of having one's shadow stolen by a shadow thief is not pleasant&mdash;but stories exist of mortals who form friendships with shadow thieves, willingly allowing the monsters to accompany them on their journeys.

It calls itself Semuvig, though, in visions and legends, it is also known as the Yowling Simian, or \"the paw's monkey.\"</p>\n<p>It is unknown whether Semuvig's present state is the result of a cruel god's vindictive curse or whether the Yowling Simian chose this life for itself. Equally mysterious is the relationship between paw and owner: Perhaps the paw is a scout, though it is equally possible that the paw is fleeing Semuvig for its own reasons, possibly to prevent its master's ascent to even greater power. Whatever the true story, legends agree that the Yowling Simian must be kept away from its paw at all costs.</p>\n<h2>Semuvig's Paw</h2>\n<p>Semuvig yearns for its missing hand and possesses a modicum of power over it while in its vicinity. When Semuvig is within 120 feet of the <em>monkey's paw</em>, it can make a wish on behalf of the paw's wielder.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Semuvig, The Paw&rsquo;s Monkey Creature 23 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 20,000/48,000/90,000 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light, medium), shield, perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Occultism, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> acid, chaotic, dexterity, energy resistant (negative), evil, fire, mental, negative, sensory (darkvision), spells (Arcane: alter reality, eclipse burst, finger of death, horrid wilting, locate, paralyze, phantasmal calamity, spirit song), sturdy, wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["undead"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","aklo","infernal","necril"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["death-effects","disease","paralyzed","poison","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","value":25,"exceptions":"except magical bludgeoning"}],"dv":[],"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.688-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":9},"dex":{"mod":11},"con":{"mod":8},"int":{"mod":6},"wis":{"mod":10},"cha":{"mod":9}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":35,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":42,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":41,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Semuvig","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/semuvig_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316782,"modifiedTime":1663517460564,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Wherever they're found, these mindless abominations protect their master's treasures faithfully and often unfailingly.</p>\n<p>In its purest form, astringent armor resembles a simple empty suit of plate mail or other armor common to the region. More often than not, though, adventurers stumble upon an astringent armor after it has already claimed at least one victim. Horrifyingly, though they are mindless, suits of astringent armor seem to prefer walking around with their latest victim still crushed inside-at least until they find a fresher body to enshroud and destroy. In such cases, the astringent armor is mistaken for an armor-clad zombie or other undead, a mistake that has put many would-be thieves in an early grave. Closer inspection, however, reveals that the encased body is horribly crushed and mangled, and bits of bone and flesh stick out sickeningly through the joints in the armor's plates.</p>\n<p>In combat, suits of astringent armor single-mindedly grab their victims, then attempt to reassemble themselves around their prey. Once attached, the armor begins shrinking, slowly crushing the unfortunate body trapped within.</p>\n<h2>Varied Origins</h2>\n<p>Suits of astringent armor most commonly come about via arcane rituals, similar to those used to animate other mundane objects. Sometimes though, they manifest in other ways-such as from a curse placed on an armor-wearing warrior who betrayed the wrong witch, a fiend who possessed a suit of armor but subsequently lost its identity, or simply from raw evil energy seeping into armor from the Negative Energy Plane. In all of these cases, such suits of astringent armor possess just a bit more intellect than most of their kind, as well as a spark of genuine wickedness.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Astringent Armor Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (negative, positive), sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["construct","mindless"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed","death-effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.710-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Astringent Armor","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/astringent_armor_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316785,"modifiedTime":1663517460565,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

So named for their predilection for drinking blood through their snout-like proboscises, blood mice also sport strong back legs made for jumping and a long tail with a ball of fur on the end. Tiny glands in the fur ball emit pheromones that the blood mouse can use to dull prey's defenses or distract predators. Either way, the blood mouse's only true means of self-defense is its needle-like proboscis, which it uses to fight with as well as feed.</p>\n<p>A single blood mouse is hardly a threat to most larger animals, but it is not uncommon to encounter blood mice in packs of three to five. While not typically aggressive, blood mice defend their dens and offspring ferociously. A short gestation period and high metabolism means that unprotected feeding grounds might become overrun with blood mice in a matter of days. Solitary blood mice usually do not attack larger creatures, preferring smaller prizes such as bugs, small birds, or voles.</p>\n<h2>Prestigious Pet</h2>\n<p>In certain high society circles, people have tried to domesticate blood mice to serve as pets.

When intertwined with another creature's nervous system, the root-like fibers that trail from their torso allow the hook melon a limited amount of control over a creature's movements. They use this control to travel as far as possible from their parent tree and seek out a suitable place to sprout, often bludgeoning their unwilling host into unconsciousness or death in the process.</p>\n<p>Hook melons possess a surprising degree of intelligence for a plant, considering the sophistication required to control another creature's body.

When inert, a nobbler appears to be nothing more than an empty sack made of leather, burlap, or hemp. While mobile, however, the creature takes a roughly humanoid shape, resembling a skulking kidnapper wearing a heavy cloak. A glance at the cloak's interior reveals nothing but yawning darkness.</p>\n<p>Kidnappers send nobblers to track their targets in large towns, cities, and other densely populated areas where the nobbler can easily pass through unnoticed. Nobblers are almost always sent to collect targets and return them alive, making bag-people useful to duplicitous despots as well as run-of-the-mill ransomers. Enemies of the crown often find themselves on the wrong side of a nobbler so that one unscrupulous noble or another can exploit them with blackmail, imprisonment, or brainwashing.</p>\n<p>Nobblers possess no intellect and frequently perform their orders to a frustratingly literal degree. When a nobbler is unable to locate its target, it might simply go inert until someone matching the target's description wanders by. As time goes on, the nobbler becomes frayed and its senses dull, expanding the scope of what it considers its quarry. It is not uncommon for adventurers and other interesting-looking folk to encounter confused nobblers in sewer gutters or alleyways.</p>\n<p>Unlike a bag of holding, a nobbler expels its contents when destroyed.

expedite the natural deterioration of architecture and items in ancient and abandoned castles, dungeons, and vaults. They are patient and methodical in this goal, as it can take a group of ruin bruisers months or years to erode and erase the last specks of a particular fortress or stronghold.</p>\n<p>Ruin bruisers resemble suits of animated ceremonial full plate armor made of marble, inlaid with bronze. The ornate designs are caked with grime and worn with age. A dull red glow emanates from within the joints of the armor, and large, ovular eyes glow golden from beneath the full helm. They carry marble shields, banded with iron and bearing symbols of forgotten meaning.</p>\n<p>Ruin bruisers typically appear in groups of up to a half dozen in old underground locations, such as remote dungeons and forgotten tombs. They use their decaying touch to crumble worked stone and wood, destroy traps and passages, and cause tools and weapons to rust away. Any magical items or artifacts which resist ruin bruisers' powers wind up in deep holes the bruisers dig under the place's foundation specifically to hide such things. Many adventurers have spent their entire lives scouring locations effaced by ruin bruisers in the hopes of finding one of these treasure-filled chasms. For their part, ruin bruisers tend to ignore living creatures, only attacking in self-defense or as necessary to continue their mission. Canny treasure hunters can take advantage of a site being dismantled by ruin bruisers, as traps may no longer function, guardians creatures may have been dealt with, and treasure may already be consolidated into a neat pile.</p>\n<h2>Erasing Tracks</h2>\n<p>The first ruin bruisers were created by a group of vile dwarven witches who, tired of living on the outskirts of civilization, sought to integrate themselves into nearby towns and cities. They created ruin bruisers to systematically destroy their former hideouts, fortresses, and dungeons, which had become too numerous to remember and contained equally innumerable evidence tying the witches to their foul deeds. That was long ago, however; since then, ruin bruisers have spread far beyond the mountains from which they originated.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Ruin Bruiser Creature 6 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, chaotic, constitution, energy resistant (negative, positive), lawful, sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["construct","earth"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed","death-effects","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","value":5,"exceptions":"except adamantine"}],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.916-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":-5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Ruin Bruiser","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/ruin_bruiser_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316826,"modifiedTime":1663517460582,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Like wildfires themselves, wildfire leshies are part of the miraculous and mysterious cycle of life, death, and rebirth.</p>\n<p>Similar to other leshies, wildfire leshies typically arise when a druid infuses a body of vegetation with a nature spirit, but spontaneously manifested wildfire leshies are far from unknown. Their small, stocky bodies are formed of tightly packed charred wood and twigs, and their sunken eyes and mouth resemble smoldering embers. Druids mesmerized by the power and beauty of fire find a good ally indeed in the form of a wildfire leshy, whose gentle heat can keep their friend warm at night and whose gravelly voice is not dissimilar to the sound of crackling firewood.</p>\n<p>Wildfire leshies have an intuitive understanding of the natural balance in highly flammable natural areas such as forests and plains. Although wildfires are anathema to many animals and plants, certain kinds of life&mdash;including wildfire leshies themselves&mdash;rely on the natural cycle of fire, decay, and regrowth in order to flourish. Wildfire leshies use their preternatural knowledge of this cycle both to fight premature wildfires and to spark the first flames in areas overdue for a fiery cleansing. Whenever possible, wildfire leshies recruit the aid of other wild creatures, including other types of leshies, to usher vulnerable creatures toward a safe refuge before starting their inferno. Since they require little air to breathe and can see through even the thickest smoke with ease, wildfire leshies are also excellent at rescuing creatures caught in a wildfire before it's too late.</p>\n<h2>Born of Fire</h2>\n<p>Wildfire leshies aren't the only such plant creatures to emerge from the ashes of a wildfire. Certain varieties of fungus leshies, for instance, can manifest only in the aftermath of a forest inferno, much like morel mushrooms.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Wildfire Leshy Creature 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 5/12/22 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Athletics, Nature, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, chaotic, constitution, energy resistant (fire, positive), fire, good, sensory (low-light vision), spells (Primal: burning hands, produce flame, speak with plants), wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["leshy","plant"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, smoke vision"},"languages":{"value":["common","druidic","sylvan","custom"],"selected":[],"custom":"Speak With Plants (Pyrophytic Plants Only)"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"fire","label":"Fire","value":"5","exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.938-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Wildfire Leshy","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/wildfire_leshy_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316829,"modifiedTime":1663517460584,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Its head is a writhing mass of lampreys which collectively act as the creature's eyes, ears, and mouths. Myzoforms come about when a mundane lamprey is accidentally exposed to strange and powerful magics&mdash;be it from the monstrous aboleths, wild sorcerers, or even natural sources. As a result of its exposure, the lamprey becomes pre-sapient, allowing it to feed on and digest creatures' memories as easily as a normal lamprey sucks blood.</p>\n<p>When such a pre-sapient lamprey attaches itself to another pre-sapient lamprey, the two create a kind of feedback loop as their minds interconnect and feed on and regurgitate one another's increasingly broken and bizarre memories. The lampreys then look for more lampreys to turn into their body, and the process snowballs until a myzoform is born.</p>\n<p>At this stage, a myzoform can survive on its own experiences and memories, but most myzoforms find themselves addicted to the \"fresh\" memories of other creatures. These thirsty creatures are often found haunting towns, cities, and other urban centers rich with potential prey on whose minds they can absorb. When a myzoform strikes from the shadows and latches onto the mind of an unfortunate local, they absorb everything&mdash;personality, memories, knowledge&mdash;and leave in their wake only an amnesiac.</p>\n<p>The most gluttonous and malicious myzoforms have fed on countless minds throughout their lives, and they might contain hundreds or even thousands of consumed personalities. As the number of minds inside them increases, only the most powerful myzoforms can stay in control; most eventually break down and self-destruct as their collective minds become a civil war of different fears, ideologies, and motivations</p>\n<h2>Crisis of Consciences</h2>\n<p>Although some myzoforms can be genuinely malicious, those are rare. Many myzoforms feel highly guilty over their nigh unstoppable impulse to feed on other sapient beings. Some rationalize their behavior by saying they can't control their impulses, while others might try to cure themselves of their \"curse\" and seek outside help to overcome their insatiable addiction.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Myzoform Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Occultism, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> acid, bane, chaotic, constitution, energy resistant (positive), evil, force, intelligence, mental, sensory (darkvision), spells (Occult: acid arrow, blindness, confusion, darkness, magic missile, tongues), wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["aberration","amphibious","swarm"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":"Tongues"},"di":{"value":["grabbed","prone","restrained","swarm-mind"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:34.966-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":6},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"ldigRFmLUDwvP1vo":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Myzoform","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/myzoform_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316833,"modifiedTime":1663517460586,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Clad only in simple rags and wielding a fearsome skull-bedecked scythe, the slaugh strikes an imposing image whether at the forefront of a zombie militia or amid the center of a bloodthirsty vampire mob.</p>\n<p>A troop led by a slaugh is a troop to be feared. Although they are not necessarily tactical masterminds, slaughs can push their units to their physical limits using profane powers to inspire and intimidate in equal measure. That said, slaughs are never content to sit on the sidelines while their minions do the fun work of slaughtering enemies. Slaughs wade into the battlefield with glee, setting a prime example for their underlings in the ways of war and brutality.</p>\n<p>Slaughs arise not from a single restless soul but from many. In order to create a slaugh, a necromancer must collect a retinue of formidable souls, each from a different army, militia, or war party&mdash;only the strongest and most imposing warriors will do. Then, a single hulking corpse is used to bind these souls into one being. Each of the dozens of magical runes etched upon a slaugh's body represent a separate soul bound to the monster. A slaugh can tap into the power of its constituent souls to either release waves of potent necromantic energy or funnel incredible power into its devastating strikes.</p>\n<h2>Traitorous Commanders</h2>\n<p>Though the methods for creating slaughs are well known to lich kings and vampire overlords alike, few necromancers dare to raise such beings for their necrotic armies because slaughs have an outsized reputation for treachery and betrayal. Perhaps this trait shouldn't come as a surprise, considering the combative nature of the numerous souls that compose a slaugh. At any rate, the fact remains that even the most loyal-seeming slaugh can be trusted for only so long.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Slaugh Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), armor (medium, heavy), perception item, skill items (Athletics, Intimidation, Lore [Warfare], Religion)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> charisma, energy resistant (negative), evil, negative, sensory (darkvision), spells (Divine: animate dead, bind undead, harm,circle of protection), strength, wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["undead"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","necril"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["death-effects","disease","mental","paralyzed","poison","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"positive","value":10}],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.017-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":1},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":6}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Slaugh","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/slaugh_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316841,"modifiedTime":1663517460590,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

This monster rapidly claims leadership of its clan through some combination of strength, charisma, and unparalleled bloodshed. In hushed whispers, as a new blood moon rises, the name of this beast floats on the lips of fearful gnolls huddled beneath their blankets&mdash;the garataur.</p>\n<p>For remote gnoll societies that revere a demonic goddess, the coming of a garataur is often seen as a sacred and important event signaling the unholy favor of the queen of demons. Such zealous communities regard the creature as a representative of the goddess, and the gnolls' former leaders willingly step down to serve the divine emissary. However, for neighboring communities, gnoll or otherwise, the arrival of a garataur means little more than fear and pain for anyone caught in the monster's path.</p>\n<p>Even the most aggressive groups of gnolls cannot compete with a war band led by a garataur, whose mind and body seem perfectly crafted for the sole purpose of slaughter. While violent gnoll communities might attack or enslave their neighbors when they are hungry or need more slaves, those groups led by a garataur actively seek out and instigate total wars. Such war bands attack until all their victims are dead or enslaved, fighting to the death. Once a fight has begun, a garataur never surrenders.</p>\n<h2>Daughters of the Blood Moon</h2>\n<p>The most powerful garataurs possess divine powers and spells akin to those of a true cleric. These garataur priests are always female and refer to themselves as daughters of the blood moon.

It thrives in mountainous and underground areas, where it gathers minerals for sustenance and reproduces asexually.</p>\n<p>Similar to how common pearl oysters produce beautiful beads of polished nacre, shale spitters produce unique, iridescent tourmaline gemstones as a byproduct of their digestion process. These gems remain embedded in shale spitters' digestive tracts and help break down hard minerals, but people in fashionable social circles prize the tourmalines for jewelry and decoration. This makes the harvesting of shale spitter gems an emerging enterprise&mdash;albeit a dangerous one, since as of yet, no one has quite figured out how to tame these crafty critters.</p>\n<p>Shale spitters are notoriously territorial and typically congregate in small packs of three to five. Their social proclivities are hardly a result of a desire for companionship; shale spitters give their fellows a modest berth. Rather, these animals gather only to cast a wide defensive net in case intruders or predators threaten their feeding and breeding grounds.</p>\n<p>Adventurers or miners hunting shale spitters must first slay a shale spitter before cracking it open to retrieve the tourmaline inside, but subduing these isopods is no easy task. Shale spitters have developed senses for detecting the faintest vibrations in their rocky homes, as well as sharp claws and teeth for burrowing away from threats. From the safety of a nook or hole, shale spitters can discourage predators by spitting stones at deadly speed or, amazingly, tapping into some primal connection with caves in order to instantaneously conjure stalagmites or stalactites.</p>\n<h2>Primal Powers</h2>\n<p>The source of shale spitters' amazing ability to summon rocky protrusions from the stone around them has stumped researchers for centuries. Cave druids maintain that the unique gemstone inside a shale spitter is responsible for this power, but so far, all experiments to eke out the tourmaline's magic have failed.</p>\n<h2>Shale Spitter</h2>\n<p>Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselves&mdash;looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Shale Spitter Creature 2 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 5/12/22 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (positive), sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","earth"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"piercing","value":3,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":3,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.100-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Shale Spitter","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/shale_spitter_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316852,"modifiedTime":1663517460596,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

In this way, they are perpetual murder machines: powered by death only so that they may inflict yet more death. Despite this, corpsesewn colossi are sometimes tasked with searching mass burial grounds or fields of war for specific corpses, such as notable commanders or heroes.

These carnivorous plant creatures roam only the world's most primeval forests, using their ability to scent blood from a mile away to track down and consume injured prey. Despite their massive size, thorn crawlers are adept at navigating dense forests; they easily squeeze under tree roots and scurry through weed-choked gulches, even climbing into the forest canopy to better survey the ground and get the drop on unsuspecting prey.</p>\n<p>Like many carnivorous plants, thorn crawlers feed on bodily fluids, leeching blood and humors into their root systems. A thorn crawler's digestive organs, such as they are, are located along the inner diameter of a hollow cavity in the monster's body. Thorn crawlers tuck captured forest critters and unwary travelers in this cavity, piercing its prey with sharp roots and swiftly draining the creature of vital fluids. Days later, a thorn crawler unceremoniously expels the victim's desiccated husk onto the forest floor.</p>\n<p>A newly introduced thorn crawler can challenge a forest's apex predators and decimate the local ecosystem if left unchecked. Rulers of nations whose forests are beleaguered by thorn crawlers sometimes arrange for formal hunts of the creatures. Because the peasantry would turn such a hunt into little more than a slash and burn of the entire forest, rulers prefer to send adventurers who have a lighter touch to hunt down and eliminate the pesky plants.</p>\n<h2>Variant Thorn Crawlers</h2>\n<p>Their ability to traverse a wide variety of terrain means that thorn crawlers can be found in forests throughout the world. Those in temperate forests typically become dormant during the winter, slumbering in thicketed ravines; those in tropical climates, however, are active year-round. Some species develop a natural paralytic poison that afflicts anyone on the wrong end of their thorns, while others have been afflicted by powerful consumed magic items or artifacts which have unlocked theretofore unknown primal powers.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Thorn Crawler Creature 10 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 125/275/500 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), spells (Primal: entangle, pass without trace), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["plant"],"senses":{"value":"blood scent, tremorsense (imprecise) 120 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"fire","value":10}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.148-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":7},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":-4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":21,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":3,"width":3,"disposition":-1,"name":"Thorn Crawler","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/thorn_crawler_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316857,"modifiedTime":1663517460599,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

legless amphibians&mdash;conjoined to a single heart-like organ. This organ produces a blood-like substance that gives its constituent critters sentience and enables them to wear and preserve human corpses for weeks. Gymnophobias have a crippling fear of having their true forms seen by other creatures, and so they wear their macabre \"disguises\" to blend in with society. Of course, an outfit made from a bloated, hardened corpse does little to dispel most people's concerns at the sight of these shambling horrors.</p>\n<p>Gymnophobias tend to dwell near graveyards, morgues, and battlefields for obvious reasons, though they are skittish and can easily be scared off to other feeding grounds. A sated, unthreatened gymnophobia is content to roll around in its rotting costume. However, many gymnophobias are quite vain, always on the lookout for new \"garments\" (flesh) or \"fashion accessories\" (body parts) to decorate themselves with.</p>\n<h2>Multiple Personalities</h2>\n<p>While a gymnophobia's dozens of tendrils share a single mind controlled by the being's heart-like organ, each individual amphibian head has its own personality. If severed, a gymnophobia's head will grow back, but with a new personality. In this way, a gymnophobia self-polices, with the more violent or belligerent heads nipping off their weaker brethren.

Unlike their more sedentary cousins, shale chargers take a far more active role in their pack's ever-expanding search for new mineral deposits. Rushing forth on its cascading rows of legs and slamming its reinforced chitinous plating into anything in its path, the shale charger silently demands anyone opposing it to stand aside&mdash;and it doesn't ask twice.</p>\n<p>Chargers can burrow at great speed, rapidly digging through even solid rock and opening up new tunnels for their smaller comrades to explore. Whereas the more common shale spitter might embed itself in an area and spend months or even years scouring a single cavern for minerals, a shale charger essentially feeds as it goes. Its simple digestive system sorts soil and sand from its nutrient-rich content as quickly as it can churn through the earth.</p>\n<p>Dwarven spelunkers and other explorers of the subterranean world rejoice at finding shale charger droppings. Where there's a shale charger, riches are sure to abound, so the thinking goes&mdash;assuming you don't first find yourself going down the wrong direction a charger's one-way tunnel.</p>\n<h2>Of Horns and Egos</h2>\n<p>Shale chargers grow hard, jagged horns atop their skulls, which aid them in both fighting as well as digging. When two shale chargers meet, the two are prone to joust for days on end, heedless of any other creatures around them. It's not uncommon for the winner of such jousts to achieve victory by snapping off the horn of its opponent. While its broken horn regrows over a course of months, a defeated shale charger is considerably more subdued, even skittish. Wounded shale chargers offer more than enough proof that these animals can feel emotions such as pride as well as humiliation.</p>\n<h2>Shale Spitter</h2>\n<p>Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselves&mdash;looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Shale Charger Creature 6 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (positive), sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","earth"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"piercing","value":5,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.250-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Shale Charger","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/shale_charger_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316870,"modifiedTime":1663517460607,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

It is said to have the head and legs of a twisted, fiendish rooster; a long, serpentine neck; and a bloated body covered in feathers that constantly and impossibly change colors. The monster's weakness is plain: Its green heart glows visibly from beneath its translucent breast, and those who know to strike this vital organ can deal massive damage. It is from this heart that the coquecigrue's most terrifying powers come from, including a soft, distorted tone that the coquecigrue can turn into a madness-inducing warble as it likes.</p>\n<p>So far, no one has been able to slay a coquecigrue and return to civilization with its body.

Yet for all their beauty and freedom, the great mythos of g'mayuns is studded with sorrow.</p>\n<p>There are two sides to every coin-joy and sorrow, peace and violence. This is a universal truth that g'mayuns know all too intimately. Long ago, they led a life of harmony with the world, celebrating beauty in all its forms but especially drawn to song. Their patron deity, a goddess of art and love, filled their hearts with joyous inspiration, and song would fill the air in their treetop jungle homes. But no mortal light nor any form of beauty is entirely safe from the jealous clutches of demonkind.</p>\n<p>Corruption was slow and subtle. Demons in disguise made their way into g'mayun enclaves and began to spread their corruptive influence. Slowly, the brilliant light of g'mayuns dimmed, and voices that once lifted in celebration cried out to the darkness in rage. It seemed they were on the edge of being forever lost, another people damned to the status of monsters.</p>\n<p>However, miracles happen, even to the most unexpected people and in the most unexpected places, and the g'mayun patron goddess wasn't willing to allow her former devotees to lose themselves completely. As subtly as the corruption spread among g'mayun culture, their patron's redemption was overt, a powerful love extending into their song and offering the hand they needed to pull them back from the brink.</p>\n<p>Now, g'mayuns are a people with souls rent between the demonic corruption, now centuries gone but still leaving scars upon their song, and the rainbow, both ancient and new, that slowly soothes them and undoes the sins of the past, generation by generation. But as ever, there are songs in their hearts-songs that, these days, speak to this harsh dichotomy. The loveliest of melodies, expressing the deepest of anguish and anger. Joy and love screamed in bitter anthems. Releasing all malevolence still within their hearts with music and art rather than succumbing to the temptations of wrath.</p>\n<h2>Incongruous Attire</h2>\n<p>The g'mayun resemble small and intensely colored humanoid birds without wings. Their feathers range over a broad and bright spectrum. These feathers grow the longest and brightest atop their heads, often standing high into the air or cascading down their backs. Their large and expressive eyes are likewise a swirl of color. This vivid appearance is often offset by their taste for the darkest of clothing, adorned with skulls, spikes, or other elements that are usually more expected of nefarious cults.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>G'Mayun Pirate Creature 0 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 2.25/5/9 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Performance, Religion, Society)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> chaotic, charisma, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), intelligence, mental, sensory (low-light vision), sonic, wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_gmayun","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, truecolor sight"},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","auran","common"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.297-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":1},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":3,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"G'mayun Pirate","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/g%27mayun_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316876,"modifiedTime":1663517460611,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

In the icy wildernesses and tundra plains where they roam, dundraths wear no leathers or clothing-only their thick, wiry coats insulate them from the bitterest elements. All the same, their razor-sharp tusks and pierced trunks strike an imposing image, and few northern wanderers willfully engage with even a solitary dundrath hunter.</p>\n<p>Dundraths have little love for art, culture, or even companionship. A dundrath's primary motivation is simple: find and devour a warm-blooded meal. More than mere hunger, this ravenous drive compels dundraths to attack mercilessly and indiscriminately, even when up against creatures significantly larger or stronger than themselves. Perhaps because of their insatiable lust for food, dundraths almost invariably delight in the hunt, and many take grotesque pleasure in the pain and anguish they inflict on living creatures. However, a dundrath doesn't belabor the point after it has successfully disabled its prey; most dundraths slaughter their victims quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Dundraths prefer to hunt alone in order to savor the choicest cuts of meat for themselves. Particularly social dundraths or a dundrath parent might take back some meager scraps for the group. Other than this practice of sharing leftovers, dundrath society is surprisingly unsophisticated, especially considering the creatures' superficial resemblances to humans and elephants-two especially social creatures.</p>\n<h2>Trunk Piercings</h2>\n<p>Dundraths do practice one form of \"art,\" though it is unappreciated to all but the dundraths themselves. From the age it can hold a sharp stick, a dundrath will painfully pierce its trunk by jabbing a frozen wooden stake into its thick hide. As it grows older, a dundrath practices this self-piercing with increasingly larger stakes and, eventually, whole logs. The ritual is equal parts practicality (log-laden trunks make powerful swinging weapons and even shields) and vanity, for the dundraths with the biggest or most elaborate piercings also often command the most respect.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Dundrath Gorger Creature 6 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Athletics, Intimidation, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> chaotic, constitution, energy resistant (cold, positive), evil, sensory (darkvision, scent), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_dundrath","humanoid"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 1 mile, snow vision"},"languages":{"value":["jotun"],"selected":[],"custom":"Dundrath"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"cold","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.380-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Dundrath Gorger","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/dundrath_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316888,"modifiedTime":1663517460617,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Shale spitter clutches&mdash;also called shale swarms or \"compactions\"&mdash;tend to emerge from their eggs all at once. Newly hatched, shale spitters are less dangerous than common voles, and so they must rely on their compaction's sheer numbers for safety. Only a few shale spitters out of a hundred survive to adulthood.</p>\n<p>Shale swarms are as adept at rooting through rock as scuttling atop it.

To say nothing of the biting, clawing swarm of isopods as individual menaces, an upset shale swarm constitutes a deadly hazard to all around it when the compaction gets to tumbling down steep mountainsides and rocky gulches. Entire caravans, mining camps, and mountain villages have been reduced to rubble as a result of so-called shale swarm avalanches.</p>\n<h2>Shale Spitter</h2>\n<p>Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselves&mdash;looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Shale Swarm Creature 3 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 7/18/30 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), fortification, sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","earth","swarm"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed","precision","swarm-mind"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"piercing","value":3,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":3,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"area-damage","value":5},{"type":"splash-damage","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.404-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":-4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Shale Swarm","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/shale_swarm_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316890,"modifiedTime":1663517460619,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

With beautiful crystalline scales, broad blue wings, and ferocious tempers, sapphire drakes strike a surprising balance between beauty and brutality.</p>\n<p>Even more so than most drakes, sapphires are extremely covetous of treasures such as gold, jewels, and pieces of art. Unfortunately for many would- be treasure hunters, sapphire drakes are also extremely good at hiding their wealth.

To acquire such servants, a sapphire drake will simply grant a humanoid supplicant a grandiose title, some chosen trinkets from its hoard, and command this new minion to dominate its fellows. While sapphire drakes are not particularly intelligent creatures, they understand their own weaknesses and value the knowledge and loyalty of their humanoid prizes. Sapphire drakes strongly detest falsehoods or illusions, and quickly eradicate any underlings they suspect of treachery.</p>\n<h2>Drakes of Avarice</h2>\n<p>According to popular legends, sapphire drakes were originally created by greedy pirate-wizards who attempted to cross- breed jungle drakes and flame drakes.

The resulting sapphire drakes proved more than up to the task, quickly eradicating their former masters and claiming the bounty for themselves.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Sapphire Drake Creature 7 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 45/100/180 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (light, medium, heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (fire, positive), evil, fire, sensory (darkvision, scent), sonic, strength, sturdy, wild, winged</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["dragon","earth"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":["draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"fire","value":5,"exceptions":""},{"type":"piercing","value":5,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":5,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.469-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Sapphire Drake","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/sapphire_drake_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316900,"modifiedTime":1663517460624,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Othruni caravans, which gather to excavate large deposits of orus crystals, are chaotic and rambunctious affairs. Many othruni forego caravans entirely and prefer the company of non-othruni to their own kinfolk, though othruni's unusual physiology makes it difficult for these fey to establish longterm traveling partners outside the winding warrens of the fey's world.</p>\n<h2>Othruni Moss and Orus Crystals</h2>\n<p>Othruni are covered in photosensitive moss called othruni moss, which crumbles quickly when exposed to direct sunlight.

But now and again, when the conditions are right, their absurd ramblings are more right than they realize.</p>\n<p>Scroll molds are colonies of color-shifting mold that have permeated and incorporated a decaying wooden scroll case into their masses, the scrolls within rendered slimy and blank. They are typically the result of magic scrolls left abandoned for too long in some musty basement or dank cavern. After extended exposure to the magic contained within the scroll case, a patch of otherwise ordinary mold develops strange new abilities&mdash;and the beginnings of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Scroll molds can barely move. Instead, they rely on their spells, camouflage, and distractions to stay safe. They generally hide in out-of-the-way spaces, preferably damp and dark nooks and crannies, tuning their color to blend in with their surroundings. If they sense approaching creatures, they instinctively create illusions to distract other creatures from their location. If still approached, a scroll mold will often try to put interlopers to sleep before casting <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.KcLVELhCUcKXxiKE]{Longstrider}</em> to slither away to a new hiding place. As a last resort, the scroll mold can use its few offensive spells, although doing so makes it obvious it is not merely a decaying scroll case to be left alone to decompose.</p>\n<h2>Hungry for Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Scroll molds have a particular taste for magic items. If a scroll mold senses magic and there is no one around, it might make its way over to the source and attempt to consume the item to incorporate it into itself. Utilizing this process, it can learn spells or develop powerful new abilities.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Scroll Mold Creature 0 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 2.25/5/9 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> perception item, skill items (Deception, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, constitution, electricity, energy resistant (positive), fire, fortification, mental, negative, spells (Arcane: burning hands, chill touch, color spray, detect magic, electric arc, ghost sound, illusory object, longstrider, sleep), wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["fungus"],"senses":{"value":"motion sense 30 feet, no vision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["critical-hits","precision","unconscious","visual"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.635-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-5},"dex":{"mod":-5},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":6,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":0,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":0.5,"width":0.5,"disposition":-1,"name":"Scroll Mold","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/scroll_mold_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316922,"modifiedTime":1663517460638,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HBJPsonQnWcC3qdX]{Hallucinatory Terrain} spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.

These dozens of souls are trapped and compounded into a single tortured, wrathful entity, doomed to haunt its theatre for eternity. Only the bravest and most talented troupe of heroes can hope to reenact the spirit's fateful performance to its climax and, in doing so, put the curtain caller to rest at last.</p>\n<p>Curtain callers have egos as big as their own ghostly forms, and they despise anyone who dares to interrupt their singing with a counter-performance. Conversely, a performer who plays along with or augments the curtain caller's eternal concert might win the caller's favor&mdash;so long as the interloper makes no attempt to upstage or outdo the spirit.</p>\n<h2>Soulful Songsters</h2>\n<p>A curtain caller can speak and understand whatever languages its constituent souls understood in life, but the entity never willfully communicates in a clear or calm manner. Rather, curtain callers are divas even in death, compelled to constantly sing, serenade, shriek, or croon&mdash;even to an empty audience.</p>\n<h2>Sitebound Spirit</h2>\n<p>When a mass tragedy like a shipwreck or theatre fire claims the lives of sailors, performers, or other inhabitants whose identities were inextricably tied to the vessel or building in which they perished, the end result is often a malevolent spirit such as a wispy wayfarer.

Likewise, anyone caught on the wrong end of a salt mother's tail are sure to receive a face full of these terrible barbed weapons.</p>\n<h2>Salt Stalker Heroes</h2>\n<p>Common salt stalkers cower helplessly beneath the dominating power of a particularly strong variety of salt stalker such as a salt scorcher or salt mother. Rarely, a common salt stalker hero might rise from the rest of its kin in order to defeat and displace a pack's resident bully or tyrant.

Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.</p>\n<p>Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Salt Mother Creature 10 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 125/275/500 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing), armor (light, medium, heavy), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (fire, positive), mental, poison, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"senses":{"value":"fluidsense (imprecise) (1 mile)"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"fire","value":10,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.726-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":5},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":3,"width":3,"disposition":-1,"name":"Salt Mother","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/salt_mother_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316935,"modifiedTime":1663517460647,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

It is a popular contraption among protective noble parents, paranoid shopkeeps, and wily wizards with questionable senses of humor. Most toy spies are crafted in the shape of a cute stuffed animal or a common knicknack unlikely to draw undo attention. In this unassuming guise, the toy spy does exactly what its name suggests, performing surveillance or reconnaissance on its creator's behalf.</p>\n<p>Parents and guardians sometimes gift their wards toy spies in order to determine when a child breaks a house rule or otherwise makes itself a menace. Other times, a toy spy might serve as a discreet and inexpensive way to protect one's home. Tinkers, inventors, and crafters learned long ago that toy spies make for much more affordable (and much less destructive) watchdogs than larger golems or animated objects.</p>\n<p>Toy spies are not designed for combat, though they do possess a few offensive capabilities, which they typically resort to only if attacked or if some other pre-specified condition is met. In addition, each toy spy is keyed to a special stone that allows its owner to identify its location and also order the spy to cast a simple spell such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o4lRVTwSxnOOn5vl]{Sleep}</em>. Once it has disabled or distracted a threat, a toy spy typically escapes as quickly as possible to safety.</p>\n<h2>Proxy's Proxies</h2>\n<p>Aristocrats and nobles steeped in politics and rivalries prize toy spies for their ability to gather intel.

Whether through carelessness, mishap, or simply the fickle hand of fate, this energy is not always directed as its summoner wishes. The parasite husk is one example of necromantic magic gone awry.</p>\n<p>A parasite husk manifests when the ritual to create a zombie utilizes a corpse that hosted unwelcome parasitic guests. The most common example found in these bodies is the tapeworm, although other, fouler, infestations no doubt exist. Deprived of nutrients upon their host's death, these creatures slowly wither away, their tiny corpses remaining within the deceased. These small carcasses provide another possible receptacle for the unholy negative energy of the creation ritual. In the right circumstances, the negative energies can awaken these parasites, and instead of a mindless and relatively docile zombie, a significantly more dangerous creature rises from the dead. The reanimated parasites quickly move throughout the corpse and gain the ability to direct its movements, albeit in a lumbering and ungainly fashion. Any necromancer assuming their new creation will be under their control is quickly dissuaded of this notion. Indeed, many parasite husk infestations begin with the unfortunate summoner as their first victim.</p>\n<p>At first glance, a parasite husk appears identical to a normal zombie. However, closer examination reveals a constant and disturbing motion under its skin, as the multitude of ravenous worms within slither erratically and animate the shambling body. These worms can sense living beings and are drawn to them with the more insidious desire to spread and infect new hosts. As a husk draws nearer to a living creature, more and more of its foul denizens erupt from the dying flesh and strain towards the new, more vibrant body.</p>\n<h2>Ectoparasite Husks</h2>\n<p>The most common type of parasite husk is the worm variety, such as the one presented here. However, there also exist parasite husks consisting of undead ticks, lice, fleas, and similar burrowing pests. These \"ectoparasite husks\" lack the reach of a standard parasite husk but move much faster and erupt into larger clouds of pests when their husk is destroyed.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Parasite Husk Creature 3 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 7/18/30 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (medium), perception item, skill items (Athletics)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> constitution, energy resistant (negative), evil, negative, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["mindless","undead"],"senses":{"value":"lifesense 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["death-effects","disease","mental","paralyzed","poison","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"positive","value":5},{"type":"slashing","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.767-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":-3},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":4,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Parasite Husk","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/parasite_husk_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316941,"modifiedTime":1663517460650,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Most adventurers take unpleasant grime as a given in the sodden crypts and ruins they frequent and so pay no heed to rooms that appear to be dripping with rank mildew. Such precariousness has led to many spelunkers' demise as they simply walk unknowingly into a chamber ooze's stretched-out stomach. The ooze then snaps in on itself, smashing its victims with ooze-wrapped furniture before engulfing its unsuspecting prey.</p>\n<p>To ensure prey wanders into its trap, a chamber ooze must perfectly align its two orifices with the room's most likely points of entry, such as a doorway, a trapdoor, or a chute in the ceiling. However, because they cannot see use logic in any real sense, chamber oozes sometimes slightly (or totally) miscalculate the entryways. In this way, a chamber ooze might spoil its own ruse by positioning its mouths around obviously obstructed openings like false doors or collapsed tunnels. At other times, a chamber ooze can inadvertently reveal the existence of hidden doorways or the true nature of illusory walls, such as by leaving a suspiciously door-shaped gap in the orange fungus that otherwise coats a room's walls.</p>\n<h2>Allies of Convenience</h2>\n<p>Though mindless, chamber oozes sometimes exhibit uncanny deference to certain other dungeon denizens, most notably mimics. The ooze allows the mimic to dwell within its space, then the two fight in tandem to create a perilous encounter for treasure hunters. Of course, sometimes a chamber ooze might get carried away and consume its weakened mimic friend as well. The smartest mimic partners make sure to have a clear path to the room's exit at all times.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Chamber Ooze Creature 5 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 18/45/80 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning), perception item, skill items (Athletics)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> acid, bane, constitution, energy resistant (acid, positive), fortification, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["mindless","ooze"],"senses":{"value":"motion sense 60 feet, no vision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["acid","critical-hits","mental","precision","unconscious","visual"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.782-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":-4},"con":{"mod":6},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":5,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Chamber Ooze","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/chamber_ooze_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316943,"modifiedTime":1663517460651,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Tyrannosauruses and other large dinosaurs are popular bases to work from. The crafter can then take the bones of smaller animals, sharpen them, and fasten them around the dinosaur skeleton to create jagged spines, extra tails, bladed elbows, or \"wing scythes.\"</p>\n<h2>Bone Spitters</h2>\n<p>Skeletal monstrosities can fling their very bones at foes, either sending a single large rib slicing through the air or exhaling a violent blast of fine bone shards. Because they are able to consume other creatures' bones and incorporate them into their own bodies, skeletal monstrosities never lack ammunition.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Skeletal Monstrosity Creature 10 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 125/275/500 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Intimidation)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> dexterity, energy resistant (cold, electricity, fire, negative), evil, mental, negative, sensory (darkvision), strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["mindless","skeleton","undead"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["death-effects","disease","mental","paralyzed","poison","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"cold","value":10,"exceptions":""},{"type":"electricity","value":10,"exceptions":""},{"type":"fire","value":10,"exceptions":""},{"type":"piercing","value":10,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":10,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"grg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:35.802-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":4,"width":4,"disposition":-1,"name":"Skeletal Monstrosity","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/skeletal_monstrosity_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316945,"modifiedTime":1663517460653,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Lonely, angry, and twisted, plant husks sow their monstrous madness in the fertile corpses of wanderers who dare travel through the husk's blighted swath of wilderness.

Kovalcik"},"creatureType":"","blurb":"","publicNotes":"<p>Silk-tailed beetles are 3-foot-long insects that hail from the fey realm. They are named after their waxy, iridescent tails, which appear soft and silky but are in fact made up of millions of tiny, sharp, brittle barbs, each no wider than a strand of human hair. Each tail hair is coated in a dangerous venom that damages as well as bewilders foes.</p>\n<p>The distinctive markings on a silk-tailed beetle's shell further confound predators. To the uninitiated, the shell appears to be some kind of disturbing face, with the beetle's tail resembling a spiky tongue. But creatures who try to attack the silk-tailed beetle from behind find themselves with a mouthful of sticky, bitter-tasting fibers instead of a tasty treat. While the would-be predator reels from the venom, the beetle makes a quick getaway.</p>\n<p>In the realm of the fey, gremlins, brownies, and other miniature fey sometimes use silk-tailed beetles as mounts or beasts of burden. These beetles are surprisingly clever, making them easy to befriend or train for simple tasks but also prone to disobedience. While larger fey tend to keep silk-tailed beetles to milk their venom and farm their barbs, some train them as battle companions. When treated kindly and with respect, a silk-tailed beetle is a loyal ally who might even put its life on the line to protect its master.</p>\n<p>In the wild, silk-tailed beetles use their saw-like front limbs to chop off small branches to make tiny hovels for shelter. During mating season, males create elaborate hovels, using their barbs to create glittering masterpieces on the ground. Before they sleep or mate, they implant a few of the barbs from their tails into the ground to ward off predators.</p>\n<h2>Stolen Barbs</h2>\n<p>A silk-tailed beetle's venom remains viable for a few days after its barbs are removed. Clever animals such as tool-wielding primates, crows, and many of the cunning beasts of the fey realm sometimes form symbiotic relationships with silk-tailed beetles, stealing the barbs the beetles use to protect their dens and nests for their own purposes.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Silk-Tailed Beetle Creature 2 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 5/12/22 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, constitution, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), mental, poison, sensory (darkvision, scent), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast","fey"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[],"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:36.015-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":9,"saveDetail":"","base":9},"reflex":{"value":10,"saveDetail":"","base":10},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":"","base":7}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Silk-Tailed Beetle","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/silk-tailed_beetle_token.webp","scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517316976,"modifiedTime":1663517460669,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

However, children outgrow their playthings and eventually discard old, worn, or musty toys&mdash;even magical ones. After enough time of neglect, the enchantments that control a wondrous toy begin to degrade or warp, and these once jovial dolls and baubles can morph into something sinister. Such a heinous phenomenon is compounded when a group of such twisted toys come together to form a toy swarm.</p>\n<p>From animated toy soldiers to talking teddy bears, any toy that's been enchanted with magic can become part of a toy swarm. Although forgotten or discarded toys make up the majority of these amusive hoards, toy swarms can also comprise new toys. Such is sometimes the case when a group of children pester the local curmudgeonly wizard a few too many times and the wizard, fed up, transforms their toys and trinkets into a scuttling nightmare. Similarly, a toy chest accidentally exposed to a large quantity of enchantment or transmutation magic can similarly be transformed into a toy swarm.</p>\n<p>Most toy swarms desire only to be reunited with their original playmates or find some other child to entertain, but the way they go about this can be frightening or dangerous indeed.

To creusadaemons, a victim's burning fever, chilling shakes, and phlegmatic cough combine to create a beautiful symphony of agony. To other daemons, however, a creusadaemon's meddling is sometimes more of a detriment than a boon; the same magical fever that a creusadaemon induces in a mortal can, in fact, ultimately purge the victim of the disease inflicted on it by some other daemon.

They wear baggy, bright red pants and sport ladybug-like wings on their bare backs. Whether in flight or on foot, galtzagorri flit about with purpose, zigzagging between trees and buildings with equal ease. On the Material Plane, galtzagorri tend to avoid big cities but might be found in woodland settlements or any heavily forested area that resembles their wild home.</p>\n<p>For a galtzagorri, unemployment is a fate worse than death. Its nimble fingers twitching with anticipation, an unoccupied galtzagorri is prone to buzz about the land in search of overworked artisans, beleaguered farmers, and frazzled spellcasters eager to delegate their menial tasks. Once bonded to a skilled practitioner or spellcaster, a galtzagorri goes about any task, big or small, with enthusiasm, from tinkering with a malfunctioning construct to washing the windows. Galtzagorri are also helpful in battle, all too eager to swiftly disarm and disassemble their enemies' weapons.</p>\n<p>While its bonded master may initially see the creature as a blessing, a galtzagorri's relentless industriousness can also be a curse. An underworked galtzagorri quickly becomes agitated, undoing with frenetic anxiety the tasks it has already completed. If completely idle, it may even sabotage simple mechanical devices only so that it can fix them again. An artisan or spellcaster can rid themselves of an unwanted galtzagorri by trapping it in a small box and gifting it to another who may need the creature's \"help.\"</p>\n<h2>Galtzagorri Possessions</h2>\n<p>Money and ownership are so inconsequential to a galtzagorri that it would have no qualms about scratching a priceless jewel in an effort to fix a twisted prong.

These individuals are the de facto hunters, scouts, and caretakers of their packs, and they find a great level of community among their kind. Salt stalkers regard their less-common kin&mdash;salt scorchers, stalk stalkers, and the terrifying salt mother&mdash;as overbearing but necessary elements to maintain the harmony of the pack.</p>\n<p>An adult salt stalker resembles a greyhound crossed with a giant lizard, possessing rock-brown skin, double-jointed legs, and wicked claws. The salty bile they naturally secrete from their scaly, chitinous skin culminates in brittle, jagged \"spines\" that poke out from every part of their bodies. These spines break off easily, but also regrow rapidly. Although its primary means of offense are its wicked teeth and powerful jaws, a salt stalker can also forcibly eject its venom-loaded spines and ably aim them toward distant prey.</p>\n<h2>Salt Stalker Roles</h2>\n<p>Different kinds of salt stalkers have evolved to fill different niches within their packs. A pack might include just one type of salt stalker or a mix of different types. The latter variety of pack tends to have a much more complicated social structure and power hierarchy, with different roles and even sub-roles for the different kinds of salt stalkers present. Regardless of the pack's complexity, though, few people could hope to understand the beasts' inscrutable social customs, mating dances, and their range of screeching yips and hair-raising calls, all of which strongly suggest a creature that is quite literally an alien to this world.</p>\n<h2>Salt Stalker</h2>\n<p>Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.</p>\n<p>Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Salt Stalker Creature 4 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 12/27/50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), poison, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"senses":{"value":"fluidsense (imprecise) (1 mile)"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.496-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Salt Stalker","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/salt_stalker_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319056,"modifiedTime":1663517460688,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

While some who spend all their days on land might think these stories are exaggeration or imagination, those who have sailed the seas know there is more truth to them than not. From giant squid to jellyfish, strange creatures inhabit the depths of the world's oceans. Every ship that sails the sea is bound to encounter such a creature sooner or later. One of the lesser-known of these ocean dwellers is the giant glaucus slug, a monstrously oversized version of the common blue glaucus sea slug.</p>\n<p>Like their miniature kin, these shell-less mollusks float upside down on the water's surface using their long, slender appendages (cerata) to create surface tension. They do not locomote on their own but instead rely on winds and ocean currents to drift across the sea. A glaucus slug's blue and silver coloration acts as camouflage, blending into the deep blue of ocean water from above and the white reflected sunlight from the ocean's surface from below. While the silhouette of a glaucus slug resembles the outstretched wings of a dragon, these aquatic animals bear no relation to true dragons, despite their colorful alternative name, \"blue dragon slugs.\"</p>\n<p>By themselves, glaucus slugs are not especially dangerous. However, swimmers and sailors should still be wary when a glaucus slug appears. They both serve as a warning that venomous jellyfish may be nearby and can be deadly to encounter themselves when full of fresh jellyfish venom.

Slightly shorter and much stockier than their kin, salt scorchers frequently lead salt stalker hunting parties, if only because, in addition to possessing fiery tempers, they are natural-born bullies. Salt scorchers rarely band together with other salt scorchers since they often let their pride get the better of them.</p>\n<p>The viscous grease that salt scorchers spray from their mouths is no mere spittle; the caustic sputum eats through living and non-living matter much like acid, though it is plain to all who experience it that the potent goo courses with flame, pure and simple. Worse, this greasy mixture reacts violently with water, making a bad situation worse for anyone unfortunate enough to try and douse the grease with a canteen or, gods forbid, jumping into a pond.</p>\n<p>Hunting packs led by salt scorchers toe a precarious line. All salt stalkers, scorchers included, are dramatically weakened by water, yet salt scorchers' caustic grease often causes its prey to seek out exactly that. If a burning victim were to fling a wineskin full of water at the salt stalkers rather than attempt to douse its own grease fire, that creature would be much better off, and the salt stalkers weakened. Luckily for the salt stalkers, most prey don't figure this out before succumbing to their wounds.</p>\n<h2>Salty Runoff</h2>\n<p>The salty bile that seeps from a nest of salt stalkers can quickly render nearby still or slow-flowing water sources undrinkable. An adventurer's first clue that something might not be right in this desert is an oasis full of saltwater.</p>\n<h2>Salt Stalker</h2>\n<p>Salt stalkers are cunning ambush predators that rely on pack tactics in order to harry and exhaust their prey, which includes any animal foolhardy enough to wander through salt stalkers' stretch of desert. Salt stalkers live in only the hottest and driest deserts, where few people even dare to go. In these uninhabitable sandscapes, where even a single cactus fails to take root, salt stalkers flourish.</p>\n<p>Unlike nearly every other form of life, salt stalkers regard water as anathema. Their alien anatomy violently revolts if they so much as try to digest fluids, and so salt stalkers rely on a strict diet of dehydrated meat. Fortunately for them, salt stalkers' unusual biology also makes it easy for them to dry out wet food: a salt stalker's bite injects a potent hygroscopic venom, dramatically dehydrating afflicted creatures in a matter of minutes. Once the poison has done its work, the salt stalkers in the hunting pack howl terribly, signaling to the rest of their kin that it's time to feast.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Salt Scorcher Creature 6 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, constitution, energy resistant (fire, positive), fire, poison, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"senses":{"value":"fluidsense (imprecise) (1 mile)"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["fire"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.721-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Salt Scorcher","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/salt_scorcher_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319083,"modifiedTime":1663517460702,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

The mere sight of one of these skull-faced bloodhounds is often enough to motivate a wandering soul to fall back in line and, in this way, fylakas keep the flow of souls moving through purgatory both steady and orderly.</p>\n<p>Physically, fylakas resemble oversized canines of various breeds, with mastiffs and bloodhounds being particularly common types. A skeletal mask mimicking the fylaka's own bone structure covers its face while its eyes glow and seep with flowing wisps of green and purple divine energy.

For one thing, psychopomps aren't particularly in the business of destroying souls. Rather, fylakas instead try to trap and escort souls to where they need to be.

Under certain conditions, this devotion to the study of math, science, and transmutation can take on a life all its own. When a potentially powerful recipe or formula is left on the crafting table half- finished, it can manifest the will to pick up where its creator left off. Overnight, the composition feverishly works itself into completion and beyond, forming an incomprehensible proof that has a mind of its own. Alchemists have come to lovingly call these mathematically animated pages living proofs.</p>\n<p>Physically, living proofs are usually composed of nothing more than parchment and ink. They mobilize by folding and re-folding themselves like origami. Though this talent allows living proofs to take on just about any shape, they tend to choose forms that resemble miniature versions of their creators or, rarely, some other creature important to the proof. For example, a living proof written in snake's blood might take the guise of a papery serpent. Similarly, a living proof whose first sight upon animating is that of a caged specimen such as a chimera or owlbear might model itself after such a monster.</p>\n<p>Although most living proofs dedicate themselves to one particular area of study, the occasional specimen might become a polymath if they were designed by a particularly genius alchemist. If abandoned or forgotten, a living proof may wander from its laboratory to seek a new master to inspire and aid, though they are otherwise loyal assistants. Sometimes this loyalty goes a bit too far&mdash;more than one alchemist apprentice has wound up injured after dawdling in their master's lab after hours and stumbling upon a seemingly mundane sheet of parchment come to life.</p>\n<h2>Unusual Materials</h2>\n<p>Living proofs made of unusual materials&mdash;such as vellum, stone tablets, or even chalkboards&mdash;are not unknown.

They prefer these environs because trees and buildings alike boast plentiful branches, ledges, and crannies from which they can swing and drop. Though hook hangers are bipedal, their legs are little more than vestigial stumps. Rather, these killers locomote by swinging along tree canopies and permeable ceilings using the strange hooked limbs that extend from their shoulder blades. Hook hangers can lope along the ground using their heavily muscled arms, similarly to gorillas, but they generally resort to terrestrial combat only as a last resort. Whenever possible, they hide in darkness above their prey and fight from the shadows.</p>\n<p>Hook hangers are misanthropic killers who disdain all other forms of life and find great pleasure in killing and maiming just about anything that crosses their path. They move with eerie silent grace and communicate with one another using an Aklo form of sign language, but they clearly possess the power of hearing, for their favorite types of victims are those who can scream.</p>\n<p>Hook hangers sometimes gather in groups and follow a particularly charismatic and vile hanger. Such \"hook mobs\" can wipe out entire settlements or regions of life, foregoing their usual stealth and ambush tactics for wanton slaughter. More often, however, hook hangers act as solitary hunters or independent mercenaries for more powerful beings.</p>\n<h2>Unknown Origins</h2>\n<p>Hook hangers are encountered all over the world and in just about any locale, from insular riverside villages to the heart of the jungle to the depths of subterranean caverns, making it difficult to determine their \"native habitat.\" The most logical explanation for hook hangers' proliferation is that some malevolent intelligent being purposefully sowed these horrors across the world, though what being&mdash;and for what purpose&mdash;none can say.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Hook Hanger Creature 7 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 12/27/50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (positive), evil, sensory (darkvision), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["aberration"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["aklo"],"selected":[],"custom":"Aklo Sign Language"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.841-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"ldigRFmLUDwvP1vo":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Hook Hanger","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/hook_hanger_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319098,"modifiedTime":1663517460710,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Their large bodies strike a distinctive silhouette on moonlit nights: serrated claws, wide jaws, and oversized ears combine to form the image of a natural-born killer. Though these powerful predators were not born-they were made.</p>\n<p>The first afneith was created by a cabal of desert-dwelling druids who served a cat-adoring pharaoh. When the pharaoh died, her will stipulated that her tomb not be guarded by constructs or soldiers but by a feline beast of her own peculiar specifications. The druids worked tirelessly to create such a beast, enlisting royal clerics and wizards to aid their quest. In the end, they created a beast so fearsome that they were only too glad to lock it away in their pharaoh's tomb. As a safeguard in case the beast should escape, the spellcasters ensured that the afneith had an easily exploitable weakness to the belladonna herb-a weakness that they tried to keep secret but which has inevitably become common knowledge to sarcophagus-robbing treasure hunters.</p>\n<p>Afneiths physically differ from their typical cat relatives in several ways. Their massive pointed ears act like funnels for sound, allowing them to pinpoint even the stealthiest tomb robbers. With their flexible skeletal structure and slack flesh, afneiths have little trouble slinking through tight corridors and alcoves to reposition and get the edge in an encounter. Finally, they possess an advanced intellect that allows them to override some of their feline instincts and invent complex strategies.</p>\n<h2>\"Domesticated\" Afneiths</h2>\n<p>Afneiths have long spread beyond the pharaonic mausoleums in which they were initially confined. Desert travelers who overcome their initial fright might hope to befriend the wandering beast; afneiths are supposedly loyal friends once their trust is earned with food and affection. Skeptics claim that afneiths nearly always appear aloof to others' needs and seem primarily motivated by food and play. Conversely, afneith supporters point out that many humanoids are motivated by these same things.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Afneith Creature 8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 64/140/250 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing, slashing), armor (light, medium), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Society, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), sensory (darkvision, scent), wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, echolocation (precise) 60 feet, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"selected":[],"custom":"Can't Speak Any Language"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.864-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":-2},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":2,"width":2,"disposition":-1,"name":"Afneith","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/afneith_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319101,"modifiedTime":1663517460712,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

These mountainous monstrosities resemble quaking mounds of chitinous plating, sedimentary rock, and mineral formations. Countless crystalline structures and gemstone deposits pock the ancient being's carapace, creating a constellation of dazzling jewels that range from common quartz to lustrous diamond. Their massive size means shale behemoths confine themselves to only the largest underground caverns. When it must relocate, a behemoth's lumbering journey shakes the entire mountain in which it dwells.</p>\n<h2>Priceless Carapace</h2>\n<p>A shale behemoth's body is covered in a dragon's horde worth of rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other gemstones. Mysteriously, many shale behemoths grow not only mundane minerals and gems on their carapaces, but also alchemical and magical stone items such as thunderstones, <em>elemental gems</em>, and even powerful <em>crystal balls</em>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the mundane gems and the magical items that protrude from a shale behemoth's body, this gentle giant grows a unique form of acoustically sensitive crystal that can generate and amplify deafening sonic signals. A shale behemoth won't usually go out of its way to attack smaller creatures, but when threatened, the animal can use its resonant crystals to generate bone-shaking shockwaves and eardrum-rupturing reverberations.</p>\n<h2>Shale Spitter</h2>\n<p>Earthen isopods that subsist on crystals and stones in order to proliferate under mighty mountains, shale spitters run the gamut in terms of the challenges they pose to spelunking adventurers. The lowliest of shale spitter kind are little more than scuttling nuisances or, at worst, swarms of stony spawn. On the other end of the spectrum are behemoths that might be called mountains in themselves&mdash;looming terrors that dominate entire caverns and give form to whole underground ecosystems. All share one common characteristic that makes every shale spitter highly sought after by fortune-seeking monster hunters: Their crystalline waste matter is literally worth more than its weight in gold.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Shale Behemoth Creature 18 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 3,000/7,000/13,000 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (piercing), armor (heavy), shield, perception item, skill items (Athletics, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (positive), sensory (darkvision), sonic, strength, sturdy, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal","earth"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 120 feet"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"piercing","value":15,"exceptions":""},{"type":"slashing","value":15,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"grg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.886-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":10},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":9},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":7},"cha":{"mod":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":33,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":25,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":30,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":4,"width":4,"disposition":-1,"name":"Shale Behemoth","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/shale_behemoth_token.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319103,"modifiedTime":1663517460714,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

A gouger wears its collection of stolen trophies on its person in the form of a macabre cloak made from its victims' flattened and stitched eyeballs. Since cloaked gougers have no eyes themselves-that part of their face is only featureless flesh-they rely on their cloaks to navigate the world and perform their foul deeds.</p>\n<p>Cloaked gougers travel far and wide looking for creatures with extraordinary eyes. Monsters with supernatural gazes, people who have seen incredible things, or beings with particularly beautiful eyes should fear the attention of a cloaked gouger. Once a gouger selects a target, it sets up an ambush and surprises its prey, paralyzing it with toxins so it can remove its prize. Gougers use alchemical elixirs to preserve the eyeballs of their victims and enhance the most desirable features of their organs. Though they rarely do so, cloaked gougers can reattach creatures' eyes as easily as they can remove them.</p>\n<p>Though undeniably wicked, gougers are said to be reasonable creatures, and on occasion, they can be convinced to heal their own victims or the victim of another gouger, but the price is always steep, and it is never guaranteed that a victim's new eyes will be the same as the ones that were stolen.</p>\n<h2>Gouger Cloak</h2>\n<p>A gouger cloak makes an impressive prize for any adventurer, but it is simply a spectacular cloak as its innate magic dies with the gouger. However, skilled crafters of magic items can tap into the cloak's inherent magic and turn a gouger cloak into the much-prized <em>@Compendium[battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e.pf2e-battlezoo-equipment.ykZotI8Zd9ntvEXY]{Cloak of Eyes}</em>.</p>\n<h2>Prized Eyes</h2>\n<p>Despite their vulnerability to gaze attacks, gougers prize the eyes of creatures such as basilisks above all others. A gouger that can claim such trophies earns incredible respect from other gougers. Even more valuable are the eyes of the medusa, a creature both feared and respected by cloaked gougers. Adventurers who can attain such eyes gain a powerful edge in bargaining with gougers.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloaked Gouger Creature 6 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (slashing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Medicine, Occultism, Stealth)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, constitution, energy resistant (positive), evil, intelligence, poison, strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["fey"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision (with cloak), lifesense (imprecise) 60 feet; no vision without cloak"},"languages":{"value":["common","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"coldiron","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.915-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":3},"con":{"mod":4},"int":{"mod":4},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Cloaked Gouger","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/cloaked_gouger_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319106,"modifiedTime":1663517460716,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

They are best known for their morbid fascination with valuables; like magpies, soloveis are drawn to shiny trinkets and intricate baubles, and so these birds frequently menace adventurers and other humanoids who cross through their territory. A solovei subdues its prey with its supernaturally shrill screeching, which stuns nearby creatures, allowing the solovei to tear its helpless victims apart before absconding with their jewelry and coins. In this way, the aftermath of a solovei attack often resembles a fatal highway robbery, causing no shortage of confusion and panic in nearby villages.</p>\n<p>Soloveis usually make their nests in the lower branches of large or intertwined trees, preferring to settle near roads where they can spot approaching prey while staying hidden. Their vestigial wings are all but useless, and so soloveis rely on their muscular legs and hand-like feet to scrabble up and down trees as needed.</p>\n<p>The vibrations induced by a solovei's warbling are so powerful that they disrupt organic matter. This includes the very trees that soloveis call home. Thus, savvy travelers might notice and avoid a solovei's nest if they're able to recognize ahead of time the distinct patches of warped and decaying vegetation in the tree canopy above.</p>\n<h2>Treasure Hoarders</h2>\n<p>Soloveis carry their stolen valuables back to their nests in order to decorate their lair and attract mates. Particularly successful soloveis can amass veritable hoards of looted trinkets, and these proud individuals often celebrate especially exciting additions to their collections with rapturous cries that can be heard from miles away.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Solovei Creature 6</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 30/65/125 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, piercing), armor (light, medium), skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, Thievery)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, charisma, dexterity, energy resistant (positive, sonic), sensory (low-light vision), sonic, wild, wisdom</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["animal"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["sonic"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.940-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":5},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-4},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Solovei","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/solovei_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319109,"modifiedTime":1663517460717,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}

Faithful adherents of this long tradition maintain a deep and personal connection with their cards, which might be handmade or have been handed down across generations. Sometimes, especially powerful diviners might inadvertently infuse their deck with a sliver of their own soul. In such cases, what was an ordinary set of cards becomes a living divination deck.</p>\n<p>These rare decks are not possessed of the personality of a single seer but rather have traits and quirks from each diviner who has wielded the cards and infused them with their spirit. Because of their close bond to the family or clan that created them, living divination decks are highly protective of their diviner and their diviner's kin. Barely sentient, living divination decks nevertheless possess some actual intellect, making them useful allies in various situations, even combat. Because it cannot speak, a living divination deck must communicate its thoughts by displaying cards in a specific order or way that conveys its meaning; such a vague mode of transmitting information, however, is rife for a comedy of misunderstanding.</p>\n<h2>Divination Deck Familiars</h2>\n<p>Living divination decks sometimes serve wizards or sorcerers as familiars, particularly specialists in divination.

Under normal circumstances, dryads are beautiful fey guardians of the forest. They become bound to great trees and rarely venture more than a few hundred feet from their homes. While the loss of its home tree can be devastating, a dryad can, in time, bind itself to a different tree.</p>\n<p>The trouble arises, however, when calamity strikes a dryad's forest and yet fails to kill the dryad. Disease, fire, logging-these and other catastrophes can prevent an uprooted dryad from locating a suitable replacement for its lost home. Such dryads wander their destroyed homeland, wracked by pain for years. Over enough time, a treeless dryad can become a dryad husk-a shell of its former self, stuck in a state of perpetual agony, bent on inflicting the same pain on others that it feels every waking moment.</p>\n<p>Dryad husks are driven by unbridled rage, particularly toward creatures they see as complicit in the destruction of forest land, which includes just about every kind of humanoid. In combat, they close with their enemies as soon as possible, forcing their foes to stare into their deformed faces in order to impart some of their anguish onto others. For a weapon, dryad husks often carry a corrupted or burned branch, the last remnant of the bound tree they lost.</p>\n<p>From a distance, a dryad husk resembles its former self as a beautiful forest nymph. Up close, however, its horrifying visage becomes plain, as does its other monstrous features-skin as dry and cracked as dead logs, tangled hair matted with mud and slime.</p>\n<h2>Other Husks</h2>\n<p>Dryads aren't the only nymphs capable of transforming into a husk-like abomination. Naiad husks appear to be made of fetid, murky water. Similarly, the husks of once- golden-hued hesperides resemble a twilight sky reflected through a shattered mirror.</p>\n<h2>Husk</h2>\n<p>Plant creatures share a special bond with the natural world that few other beings can completely understand or appreciate. When the bond to its realm is broken or severed, a sentient plant creature's rage can transform it into a terrible shadow of its former self. Benign and even friendly plants like leshies, arboreals, and dryads all run the risk of this horrible metamorphosis, though their own agony often pales in comparison to the horrors which they inflict on their victims. Lonely, angry, and twisted, plant husks sow their monstrous madness in the fertile corpses of wanderers who dare travel through the husk's blighted swath of wilderness. Though in their eyes any living creature is worthy of obliteration, husks reserve their most horrendous punishments for any litterer, land settler, or lumberjack who ever dared to desecrate, dominate, or denude the forest.</p>\n<h2>Monster Part Subsystem</h2>\n<p><strong>Dryad Husk Creature 3 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Monster Parts</strong> 7/18/30 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Refinements</strong> weapons (bludgeoning, slashing), armor (light), perception item, skill items (Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Stealth, Survival)</p>\n<p><strong>Eligible Imbued Properties</strong> bane, chaotic, charisma, dexterity, energy resistant (positive), evil, mental, sensory (darkvision), sonic, spells (Primal: darkness, fear, shatter, speak with plants, tanglefoot), strength, wild</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["fey","hb_husk","nymph","plant"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":["common","elven","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":"Speak with Plants"},"di":{"value":["emotion"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"type":"coldiron","value":5}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.788,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-18T12:08:38.993-04:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.285","system":"4.0.6"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":1},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"ownership":{"default":0,"bWA8khYkEWvh0G5V":3},"prototypeToken":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Dryad Husk","actorLink":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"light":{"alpha":0.25,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/battlezoo-bestiary-pf2e/art/Tokens/dryad_husk_token.webp","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.6","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663517319115,"modifiedTime":1663517460721,"lastModifiedBy":"IWDF0nA8gEs5avF1"}}
