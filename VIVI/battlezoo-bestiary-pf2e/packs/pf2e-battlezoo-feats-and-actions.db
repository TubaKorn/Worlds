Choose one of the innate cantrips from the monster you defeated for the prerequisite; you create a token from that monster's body which contains that cantrip, using the same tradition as the monster did. Write down the kind of monster, the spell, the tradition, and a quick description of the token's appearance. You cast spells by preparing them from your tokens, which you collect from the monsters you defeat using the Create Token activity. Your tokens only work for you, and you can't share spells with other spellcasters, even other monster mages, or use the Learn a Spell activity to learn more monster mage spells. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} activity. You can prepare up to two cantrips each day from the spells in your tokens (though you only start with one initially until you defeat another monster with a different innate cantrip). You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the spells you can from your tokens regardless of their tradition, but you don't become trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for other spells you cast. Your key spellcasting ability for monster mage archetype spells is Wisdom, and when you cast them they are monster mage spells cast from spell slots, not innate spells.
